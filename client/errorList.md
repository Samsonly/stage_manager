unexpected Crash when using "Open Project" from nav bar while project is already loaded

In Carly, Rosaling Franklin says "if you love your entire life..." And the line note click only grabs PART of the line.

In line notes, if size of added or dropped words formatting pushes text out of view, there is no scroll bar, only pushes it over the black dialog window (there is never a scroll bar is seems)

When adding words in a line note the width of the input box grows as if it is growing to match the size of a larger font size

make the export button not clickable if no line notes are selected in view line notes

close and export are static in the line note viewing window when they need to be lower and scroll with the notes

urrently there is no space saved after an addedWord chunk in LineNotes.js. Do I want this? Do I want to remove all spaces?
