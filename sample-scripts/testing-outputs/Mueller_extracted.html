{stgd120} - [(JOSH has food in his mouth. He didn't even notice her walk up)]
{cdir121} - [(Surprised)]

{d11} - [I am?]
{d12} - [I am.]
{d13} - [Cool.]
{d14} - [I'll be ready at 7, and I don't like to be kept waiting.]
{d15} - [You wouldn't keep a girl like me waiting, now would you?]
{d16} - [N-n-never!]
{d17} - [I didn't think so.]
{d18} - [Friday. 7pm.]
{d19} - [Wait! I don't even know your name!]
{d20} - [My name is -]
{d21} - [Mueller?]
{d22} - [Mueller? MUELLER!]
{d23} - [Hmm?]
{d24} - [What's this, dweeb?]
{d25} - [Oh. My. God.]
{d26} - [Is that supposed to be you?]
{d27} - [Hey! Give that back.]
{d28} - [Aww,]
{d29} - [does somebody have a little bitty crush on the new kid?]
{d30} - [You don't actually think he'd even want to be seen with you in the hallway, let alone at the dance, do you?]
{d31} - [Yuck. Gag me with a spoon. I don't even want to be seen with you right now, and that's just in front of Brittany and Tiffany.]
{d32} - [Take a chill pill, nerd girl. It's not like we were going to keep it.]
{d33} - [Yeah, we try to make it a rule not to be seen holding onto little pieces of trash.]
{d34} - [Good point, Tiffany. We totally shouldn't even be seen standing next to it.]
{d35} - [Let's get out of here. Later, dweeb!]
{d36} - [I wonder why they call it magic tape? Seems like regular old tape to me.]
{d37} - [I wish you were real. I bet you wouldn't take crap from Brittany.]
{d38} - [Knock. Knock.]
{d39} - [Hey.]
{d40} - [Hey you. I didn't see you in math earlier today. Is everything okay?]
{d41} - [Yeah. I just... wasn't feeling great, so I went home early.]
{d42} - [Yeah?]
{d43} - [Yeah.]
{d44} - [And it doesn't have anything to do with three particular airheads that are known to torment half the senior class whenever they're bored, or confused. Which is, literally every moment they miraculously remember how to breathe and walk at the same time?]
{d45} - [Maybe it had a little to do with that.]
{d46} - [But I really wasn't feeling good either!]
{d47} - [Yeah, hearing them talk always makes me want to barf too.]
{d48} - [Seriously, though, what happened?]
{d49} - [Nothing.]
{d50} - [Nothing? Don't tell me you made me sit through Mr. Foote's monotone lecture about acute angles alone for "nothing".]
{d51} - [Nothing new. Just the same old junk. They grabbed my.. drawing here]
{d52} - [, and then started picking on me like they always do.]
{d53} - [Daaaang. Who's the wicked stud?]
{d54} - [Yo, is that the new kid you were telling me about? What's his name? Jake?]
{d55} - [Josh. And it doesn't matter because that's one thing Brittany was actually right about. There's no way a guy like that would want to go to the dance with someone like...]
{d56} - [Like what?]
{d57} - [Well, like me.]
{d58} - [Jenny. Mueller. Don't listen to what the ditz or her airhead friends say about you for a single second. Do you know that last week in history, I saw Heather try and spell President Reagan's name? R-A-Y-G-U-N.]
{d59} - [I'm serious. That airhead is a major spaz. Do you really think that someone who would have likely wrote-in President Ray-gun for a third term knows the first thing about who you are, or what you're about?]
{d60} - [Do you?]
{d61} - [No.]
{d62} - [Then don't let her get into your head with all this crap. You, Jenny Mueller, are one bodacious babe, and if this Jake g-]
{d63} - [Josh.]
{d64} - [If this Josh guy is even half as great as you seem to think he is, he's going to see that too. You got that?]
{d65} - [You know, I wish you'd let yourself be a little more like the Jenny you put in your comics.]
{d66} - [They're n-]
{d67} - ["They're not comics, they're drawings", I know, I know. But I'm serious, Jenny. The only difference between you and her, is that she's not letting anyone hold her back from what she really wants.]
{d68} - [Well she's not real. No matter how much I sometimes wish she were. That's just not me.]
{d69} - [Can we just... talk about something else?]
{d70} - [Fiiine. I was gonna see if you wanted to go to the mall and grab a slice of pizza, but I'm not sure that would be such a good idea. You know, with you not feeling well and all...]
{d71} - [Hmm. That's weird. I am suddenly feeling a whole lot better.]
{d72} - [I've been told I have that effect on people.]
{d73} - [I just forgot my windbreaker. I'll be rig-]
{d74} - [AHH!]
{d75} - [Uh- Who are you? What are you doing here?]
{d76} - [I'm you.]
{d77} - [What?! What do you mean "I'm you"?]
{d78} - [Exactly that. I'm you. And you're me. We're the same. Well, close enough.]
{d79} - [You drew me.]
{d80} - [Wait. Are you saying that-]
{d81} - [No. No. No, no, no, no, this isn't possible.]
{d82} - [I assure you that it is.]
{d83} - [No.]
{d84} - [Yes.]
{d85} - [But how?]
{d86} - [Isn't it obvious?]
{d87} - [You used "magic" tape? Then you made a wish? Seems pretty obvious to me.]
{d88} - [That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. No one in their right mind would ever believe something so-]
{d89} - [Are you com- Oh, my, God. She's real. How?]
{d90} - [Jenny used Magic tape.]
{d91} - [Of course! This is amazing.]
{d92} - [This is going to be so much fun.]
{d93} - [Are you hungry?]
{d94} - [Starving.]
{d95} - [Fine. Let's go.]
{d96} - [Welcome to Shermont High School. If you're anything like Jenny here, I am sure you'll get along just fine.]
{d97} - [And I'll keep an eye out for your transfer paperwork. No idea why it hasn't come in already. In the meantime, feel free to shadow Jenny here until we get your own schedule.]
{d98} - [So is this really her?]
{d99} - [Missy! You told her?]
{d100} - [What? We tell each other everything! You know that!]
{d101} - [Even...]
{d102} - [This?]
{d103} - [Ev-ry-thing. I don't make the rules.]
{d104} - [So how did you do it?]
{d105} - [Huh?]
{d106} - [How did... you know...]
{d107} - [You don't need to talk about me like I'm not right here. I can speak, you know.]
{d108} - [Oh. I'm sorry. It's just... this is so weird. But, like "cool" weird. I was just wondering how it even happened. Like, did you use a computer or something, like that movie?]
{d109} - [No. It was Magic tape.]
{d110} - [Oooooooooh!]
{d111} - [Okay, but we can't tell anyone else, agreed? We were lucky enough to get her enrolled here. We don't need anyone asking about who she is or where she came from any more than they already do.]
{d112} - [I don't see what the big deal is. We can just tell people I'm your sister.]
{d113} - [Yeah!]
{d114} - [Noo. We can't tell people you're my sister. No one will believe that I have some sort of long lost twin.]
{d115} - [Compared to the truth, that's actually not that hard to believe.]
{d116} - [Whatever. You guys figure it out. I'm going to grab a drink.]
{d117} - [Why, hello there, Sweetcakes.]
{d118} - [Excuse me?]
{d119} - [I... uh... Di... uh...]
{d120} - [Do you come with a reset button or something?]
{d121} - [Did you do something different with your hair?]
{d122} - [I'm sorry, do I know you?]
{d123} - [Hey! Don't do me like that. You know me! C'mon. It's me Jimmy. The Jimster. Jimba-lia. Jim-Jam.]
{d124} - [I instantly regret saying that last one. Please don't ever call me that. I beg you.]
{d125} - [Jimmy!]
{d126} - [Really. Pleas-]
{d127} - [Uh, Who i... What is goi.. wait, who is this?]
{d128} - [This is... my...]
{d129} - [Yeah! She's Jenny's...]
{d130} - [Sister!]
{d131} - [You don't have a sister.]
{d132} - [Hmm?]
{d133} - [I've known you since you were four years old. You don't have a sister. I'd know if you did.]
{d134} - [No. She's not my sister. She's.. um..]
{d135} - [My name is Sara. I'm Jenny's cousin. Our mothers are sisters. That's what she meant.]
{d136} - [Oh. Doy. Yeah. I mean, I was going to say you two don't even look that much alike. Like, Jenny, you're like.... uh...]
{d137} - [and Sara, you're like... um...]
{d138} - [, which isn't to say tha-]
{d139} - [Jim-Jam?]
{d140} - [Yeah?]
{d141} - [Please leave.]
{d142} - [Yes ma'am.]
{d143} - [Jenny. Missy. Ashley.]
{d144} - [What was that all about?]
{d145} - [Ignore him.]
{d146} - [Yeah, Jimmy's been following us around as long as I can remember. He's got a major thing for Jenny.]
{d147} - [Oh look, now there's two of them. Barf me out. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse.]
{d148} - [I didn't know there was a 2 for 1 sale at Grodys"R"Us.]
{d149} - [Who's your new friend, Jenny?]
{d150} - [My name is Sara]
{d151} - [Ohmigod]
{d152} - [, like, what's your damage? Are you some sort of spaz?]
{d153} - [Not at all. I've just heard you get confused a little easily, and I wanted to make sure I didn't overload you with new information.]
{d154} - [Oh, you think that is funny, Tiffany?]
{d155} - [Kind of.]
{d156} - [Well, while we're telling jokes, maybe we should talk about the time you somehow scored lower on your spelling test than Heather here.]
{d157} - [Hey!]
{d158} - [But yeah, that's like wicked bad. I sometimes put an A in my own name.]
{d159} - [Your name is Heather. There is an A in it.]
{d160} - [Well, like... then... sometimes I forget to put an A in it]
{d161} - [Did you need something else, or do you just like being seen around us?]
{d162} - [In another life, spaz.]
{d163} - [Let's go before we catch whatever it is that makes them look like that.]
{d164} - [It's called class. You should get some.]
{d165} - [That. Was. Amazing.]
{d166} - [I've never seen anyone talk to Brittany like that before.]
{d167} - [She's just a person. You guys make her much more than she is.]
{d168} - [She's not a person. She's a demon.]
{d169} - [She is just going to be even more trouble now. Don't you realize that? I wish you would just leave her alone.]
{d170} - [Like you do?]
{d171} - [Yeah, like I do. There's a reason I don't engage with the trio. The more you fight back, the more they seek you out.]
{d172} - [If you don't engage, why do they keep seeking you out then?]
{d173} - [Whatever. You don't know them like I do. Just trust me, Brittany's not going to leave us alone just because you stood up to her.]
{d174} - [Okay. Look, I'm sorry. I just don't like the way she tries and walks all over you. I thought that was why you wanted me here in the first place.]
{d175} - [Who said I wanted you here?]
{d176} - [I'm sorry, it's just-]
{d177} - [No, I'm sorry.]
{d178} - [It's okay. Let's just... get to class. Alright?]
{d179} - [Okay.]
{d180} - [Hey, is everything butter?]
{d181} - [Yeah, it's fine. Let's just go before we're late.]
{d182} - [Are all classes as hard to sit through as Mr. White's?]
{d183} - [Not all of them. Ms. Keating's Science class is actually pretty rad.]
{d184} - [Some are worse though. Just wait until Math. Mr. Foote is Totally Bogus.]
{d185} - [No wonder you had so much time to draw me.]
{d186} - [Is that him?]
{d187} - [It sure is.]
{d188} - [I don't see what's so special about him.]
{d189} - [Someone better get Jenny a napkin before she drools all over her lunch.]
{d190} - [I'm not drooling. I'm just... admiring.]
{d191} - [From afar.]
{d192} - [Then why don't you eliminate the "from afar" part and go on over there.]
{d193} - [Yeah, look, he's sitting all by himself. It's like he's asking for someone to come and talk to him.]
{d194} - [C'mon. I thought you wanted to ask him to the Sadie Hawkins?]
{d195} - [I bet the version of you in your drawing woul-]
{d196} - [Guys, lay off, alright? I'm sure if Jenny wanted to go over and ask him, she would.]
{d197} - [No, you know what. You're right.]
{d198} - [Hi. I'm Jenny.]
{d199} - [Hmm?]
{d200} - [I said, Hi. I'm Jenny.]
{d201} - [Oh. Hey. I'm Josh.]
{d202} - [I know.]
{d203} - [You do?]
{d204} - [I do.]
{d205} - [Oh.]
{d206} - [You know what else I know?]
{d207} - [Uh, no. What else do you know?]
{d208} - [The um, dinner rolls. They, uh, use the same order all week. So while they're fresh on Mondays, by Friday they are as hard as a rock.]
{d209} - [Oh. Um, thanks.]
{d210} - [Of course. I mean, I know you're new here, and I'd hate for you to have them on a day like today, and like, totally love them, and then try and take a big bite on Friday, only to chip a tooth or something. Y'know?]
{d211} - [Oh, hey! There you are! You will not believe this thing I have to show you over here.]
{d212} - [Sorry.]
{d213} - [I warned him about Friday bread.]
{d214} - [I know. We heard.]
{d215} - [It wasn't that bad, really.]
{d216} - [I totally wish someone had warned me about Friday bread when I started here.]
{d217} - [You probably just saved him a trip to the dentist!]
{d218} - [I don't feel so well.]
{d219} - [Why don't we head to the bathroom. Okay?]
{d220} - [We'll catch you two in Science?]
{d221} - [What? It's only Wednesday?]
{d222} - [...but whatever you do, don't eat the rolls. I ate them once, and that's how I became a total spaz!]
{d223} - [Hey, I noticed you left lunch early. I wasn't sure if you had enough time to eat, so I got you this.]
{d224} - [Hey! Give that back!]
{d225} - [Bite me, nerd.]
{d226} - [You see, someone like Josh is this]
{d227} - [. Sure he's hot, but like, he's at the center of everything. You, on the other hand, are this right here]
{d228} - [. You're tiny. Insignificant. So far from everything that no one would even notice if you floated off into space.]
{d229} - [Okay, that's enough.]
{d230} - [I wasn't talking to you, poser.]
{d231} - [Well ain't that rich.]
{d232} - [Excuse me.]
{d233} - [I'm just saying that if anyone here was a poser, I'd think it was the one trying ever so desperately to appear relevant.]
{d234} - [Who are you calling desperate?]
{d235} - [You see, I already forgot how easily she gets confused.]
{d236} - [I am calling you desperate.]
{d237} - [Now give that back, sit down, and shut up.]
{d238} - [Or. What.]
{d239} - [Enough! Brittany, just please give that back to Becca. This has nothing to do with her.]
{d240} - [Fine. Here.]
{d241} - [Nice play, Shakespeare.]
{d242} - [Oh no! I thought you had it!]
{d243} - [You did that on purpose.]
{d244} - [What? No! I would never do that!]
{d245} - [You're so... heinous!]
{d246} - [Jenny...]
{d247} - [No. She needs to hear this.]
{d248} - [All you do is make fun of other people, because if you stopped, for even a second, you'd have to come to terms with the fact that like no one actually likes you. You're just a wastoid. And-]
{d249} - [Miss Mueller?]
{d250} - [Ms. Keating. It's not what it looks like.]
{d251} - [Oh? Because it looks like you're bullying Miss Maddox here.]
{d252} - [I don't know what her problem is, Ms. K. I was just trying to hand her Becca's awesome planet thing, and it fell. I think she did it on purpose.]
{d253} - [That's not wha-]
{d254} - [Enough. Miss Mueller, a moment?]
{d255} - [She's lying, Ms. Keating. I swea-]
{d256} - [Jenny. Do I look like someone who was born yesterday?]
{d257} - [Of course not. It's jus-]
{d258} - [Then do you really think that I would believe for one second that Miss Maddox has ever felt that sorry for anything in her life, let alone something that belongs to another person?]
{d259} - [No...?]
{d260} - [I'll deal with her myself. But what concerns me the most at this moment is what I walked in on.]
{d261} - [I've never heard anything negative ever come from your mouth before, but what I just saw... What's going on, Jenny?]
{d262} - [Nothing.]
{d263} - [Nothing? Jenny, I just saw you tearing down Brittany with my own eyes. Now, from what I know of Miss Maddox, I can't say that she didn't deserve some of that. Lord knows I've had to hold back a few times myself, but that's not like you, Jenny. So I ask again, what's going on?]
{d264} - [I'm sorry, Ms. Keating. I just lost control for a moment. She's just so rotten sometimes, ya'know? I don't know why she hates me so much, but it's like she has it out for me. And, well, I guess I just had enough of her walking all over me.]
{d265} - [I get it.]
{d266} - [Look, believe it or not, it wasn't that long ago I was sitting on the other side of the desk, so I know how hard it can be. The demands, the pressure... the bullying.]
{d267} - [You were picked on?]
{d268} - [Yeah, of course I was, or did you think being really into science used to be much cooler than it is now?]
{d269} - [My point is, there are more productive ways to stand up for one's self than by tearing down others. The name calling, the insulting? That's her thing. That doesn't mean it needs to be yours. Got it?]
{d270} - [Yeah. I got it. I'm sorry.]
{d271} - [Okay. Now if you'll excuse me, I think I have to go deal with what I expect to be a very distraught Miss Campbell. (beat) That was Becca's project, yes?]
{d272} - [Yes. I really am so sorry. She didn't have anything to do with what happened. I'll help her fix wh-]
{d273} - [Don't worry about it. She'll be fine. But no, if you come back in right now, without looking like I just laid into you, I'll get accused of playing favorites. How about you take the rest of the period off to get some air. I'll give your homework to Missy.]
{d274} - [Thanks, Ms. Keating, but I don't think that will be-]
{d275} - [That wasn't a suggestion, Miss Mueller. I think you need to take some time to think about how you handle such situations in the future. You understand?]
{d276} - [Yes, Ms. Keating.]
{d277} - [See you tomorrow, Jenny.]
{d278} - [Hey.]
{d279} - [Hey...]
{d280} - [So, um, Missy and Ashley were going to head over to the mall. And uh, we thought maybe you'd like to come?]
{d281} - [No thanks. I think I'm just going to head home. It's been a long day.]
{d282} - [Okay. Yeah, you're right. I'll just go tell them we'll see them tomorrow.]
{d283} - [You can still go, you know. You don't need to hover around me at all times.]
{d284} - [I know. I just thought tha-]
{d285} - [Contrary to popular belief, I managed just fine before you. Some may even say I was even better off then.]
{d286} - [If by better you mean taking everyone's crap, and not going for what you really wanted, then sure.]
{d287} - [You know what? I do. At least then I didn't get thrown out of class, or make a complete fool of myself in front of the entire school. I was better off without you, and I still am.]
{d288} - [I see. Well, if you need me, I'll be at the mall with Missy and Ashley.]
{d289} - [Great.]
{d290} - [Yeah. Great.]
{d291} - [I guess I'll just spend the night at Missy's then?]
{d292} - [Do whatever you want. That's what you're all about anyway, right? Do whatever you want, screw the consequences?]
{d293} - [That's not fair.]
{d294} - [No? Well you could have fooled me.]
{d295} - [I'll see you tomorrow.]
{d296} - [Jenny?]
{d297} - [What do you want, Jimmy?]
{d298} - [I'm sorry, I didn't mean to snoop, but I just overheard the end of that.]
{d299} - [Yeah, and? You going to tell me I'm doing everything wrong, too?]
{d300} - [No, I...]
{d301} - [Do you know how long I've known you?]
{d302} - [(shrugging) I don't know... like fourteen years?]
{d303} - [Thirteen years, two months, three weeks, and six days. Do you know how long I've liked you?]
{d304} - [Thirteen years, two months, three weeks, and a day.]
{d305} - [What about those other five days?]
{d306} - [We were four. I was pretty sure you had cooties or something at first.]
{d307} - [Ha. Oh, then you realized I didn't?]
{d308} - [No. I just realized I didn't care.]
{d309} - [Look, Jenny. My point is that I know you better than anyone at this school. Probably even better than you know yourself. Definitely better than your cousin, or whatever you say she is, does.]
{d310} - [And?]
{d311} - [Look, you like this Josh guy, right? And you want to ask him to the dance? Then ask him.]
{d312} - [I tried to ask him.]
{d313} - [No you didn't.]
{d314} - [Did you not see me humiliate myself at lunch today?]
{d315} - [Oh, I saw that. But that wasn't you asking him. That was you trying to be someone else asking him. That's what went wrong.]
{d316} - [Huh?]
{d317} - [The Jenny I know doesn't need to fake some sort of wannabe cool-girl persona. The Jenny I know, the real Jenny, doesn't need any of that, because she's already the coolest person I know. And if that Jenny had walked up to this Josh guy, and asked him out, I think it would have had a much different result.]
{d318} - [Thanks, Jimmy.]
{d319} - [You know, I'm a little surprised you'd be so willing to help me ask another guy out. Seems a little counter productive to your life goal of winning me over, doesn't it?]
{d320} - [Nah. You'll spend half a night with this guy and realize he is missing that Jimmy charm you've grown to love. It's all just part of a larger plan to make you realize what you're missing with The Jimster.]
{d321} - [You know I'm never going to call you that, right?]
{d322} - [One hurdle at a time.]
{d323} - [So you going to catch up with your cousin and your friends?]
{d324} - [No. I think I need some Jenny time tonight.]
{d325} - [I could use some Jenny time myself?]
{d326} - [Don't push it.]
{d327} - [Noted. See you tomorrow?]
{d328} - [See you tomorrow.]
{d329} - [And Jimmy?]
{d330} - [Yeah?]
{d331} - [Thanks again. I think I needed to hear that.]
{d332} - [Oh. Hey, Sara!]
{d333} - [Hey, Becca.]
{d334} - [Hey, I just wanted to thank you for your help yesterday putting my project back together.]
{d335} - [Really, it was the least I could do. I'm sorry if anything I did led 
to Brittany messing with it in the first place.]
{d336} - [Are you kidding? Brittany Maddox doesn't need anyone's help to be evil, she does that all on her own. Honestly? It was nice to see someone finally stand up to her.]
{d337} - [Yeah, well that's what I keep telling Jenny she needs to do.]
{d338} - [Oh, that would never work for Jenny.]
{d339} - [It wouldn't?]
{d340} - [No. My friend Allison, and I used to try that, and it just made our lives miserable. So now we just ignore her.]
{d341} - [And she leaves you alone?]
{d342} - [Mostly. See, Allison's boyfriend studies Psychology in college, and we were in a chatroom with him and a few of his classmates, and-]
{d343} - [I'm sorry, a what?]
{d344} - [A chatroom? Ohmigod, It's this cool new thing where you can talk on your computer to a bunch of people at once. It's totally rad. But yeah, like, anyway, we were chatting, and they told us how they learned in class that, like, most bullies just try and control the lives of their victims because of their own insecurities and, like, lack of control.]
{d345} - [Oh?]
{d346} - [Yeah, so we figure the less we let her feel like she impacts our lives, the less she'll bother in the first place.]
{d347} - [And that works?]
{d348} - [For the most part? But, it doesn't appear to protect against collateral damage.]
{d349} - [Hmm, thanks for the information.]
{d350} - [Sure. See you around!]
{d351} - [Hey.]
{d352} - [Hey.]
{d353} - [Can I talk to you for a moment?]
{d354} - [I'm sorr-]
{d355} - [I guess at least in some ways we are the same person.]
{d356} - [Ha, yeah.]
{d357} - [About that. Look, I'm really sorry for what I said yesterday. You were right, that wasn't fair of me.]
{d358} - [You were right, though.]
{d359} - [But that's just it, I wasn't. You know, ever since you popped up in my world, I think I've been feeling a little bit jealous.]
{d360} - [Jealous of me?]
{d361} - [Yeah...]
{d362} - [Jenny, I am literally a figment of your imagination. Until just a couple of days ago, I wasn't even alive.]
{d363} - [But you are alive now. You moved from this concept, this fantasy version of myself to the real deal. And now I feel like I'm stuck competing with you at every step of the way. And that this real version of myself is somehow obsolete now that the fantasy is here.]
{d364} - [Jenny...]
{d365} - [You just... You always know what to say, and you don't take anyone else's crap. I thought, I don't know, that if I acted a little more like you, maybe things would change for me.]
{d366} - [But that's not you. You don't need to force yourself to be some sort of person that you're not.]
{d367} - [Tell me about it.]
{d368} - [That's not a bad thing.]
{d369} - [Tell that to Josh.]
{d370} - [Why don't you tell him yourself.]
{d371} - [Um. Hi.]
{d372} - [Hi.]
{d373} - [So, I, uh, wanted to thank you for your tip about the bread.]
{d374} - [Oh, yeah, like, totally.]
{d375} - [I mean, I know it may sound a little lame, but that's sort of the most anyone has talked with me in the few weeks I've been here.]
{d376} - [Really? What about your friends?]
{d377} - [Have you seen me talking to anyone?]
{d378} - [I guess talking to the new kid is still a little weird for some. But anyway. I just wanted to say that was pretty cool of you.]
{d379} - [Your friend told me that it's not easy for you to reach out like that, so it meant a lot to me.]
{d380} - [My friend?]
{d381} - [Yeah. He said you don't do that sort of thing for just anyone, so I wanted to say I appreciate it.]
{d382} - [Wait, "he"?]
{d383} - [Yeah, "he". Kind of weird little guy. Says he goes by "The Jimster"?]
{d384} - [No one actually calls him that, do they?]
{d385} - [Huh? No. Not at all.]
{d386} - [Yeah. Didn't think so.]
{d387} - [Okay. Well, I'll let you get back to your lunch.]
{d388} - [It's Thursday, so.. I wouldn't eat the bread.]
{d389} - [Hey, Josh.]
{d390} - [Yeah?]
{d391} - [How would you like to go to the Sadie Hawkins with me tomorrow night?]
{d392} - [I would, um.. I would like that very much.]
{d393} - [Awesome.]
{d394} - [Yeah. Awesome. Uh, pick you up at 7?]
{d395} - [It's like you read my mind.]
{d396} - [Ohmigod. Did you just ask him to the dance?]
{d397} - [I did.]
{d398} - [And he said yes?]
{d399} - [He did.]
{d400} - [See, maybe being yourself isn't the end of the world after all.]
{d401} - [I guess not.]
{d402} - [Aww, did the little dweebette find her prince dweeb to take her to the ball? What did you do, promise to never talk to him again if he said yes?]
{d403} - [Brittany. I don't have the time, energy, or slightest care to go through these motions with you today. Whatever your problem is, you're going to have to figure that out on your own. I have a dance to plan for.]
{d404} - [You know, Brittany, if you spent half as much time building yourself up as you do tearing others down, you probably wouldn't be nearly as miserable as you seem.]
{d405} - [Bag your face, spaz.]
{d406} - [Why do you put up with her?]
{d407} - [She's not really that bad most of the time.]
{d408} - [Could have fooled me.]
{d409} - [I know she is like totally heinous at school, but when we're not here, she can like, be really nice sometimes.]
{d410} - [Having a hard time seeing that, but if you say so.]
{d411} - [Like, just last night, she spent almost three hours trying to help Heather study for her English test. She even got this new program on her computer that's supposed to help her. (beat) I just wish there was some way to help her let her guard down, so that people can see more of the real her.]
{d412} - [Hmm... maybe there is.]
{d413} - [Hey. You're Allison, right?]
{d414} - [Yes, I'm Allison. No, I won't do your homework for you. Yes, I'm serious. And No, I don't care that you "really" need it.]
{d415} - [Wha-]
{d416} - [Oh. You're the new girl, right? Sara, without an H. Jenny's cousin, yeah?]
{d417} - [Yeah, listen I-]
{d418} - [Becca here told me about what you did for her the other day.]
{d419} - [That was... nice of you.]
{d420} - [Thanks, again.]
{d421} - [What can I do for you?]
{d422} - [I was serious, I won't do your homework.]
{d423} - [No, nothing like that.]
{d424} - [Wait, do people really ask you that?]
{d425} - [You wouldn't believe how often they do. Is that what you wanted?]
{d426} - [No, sorry. I came to ask a different favor. It's about Brittany Maddox]
{d427} - [Not interested.]
{d428} - [Hear me out.]
{d429} - [Not. Interested. I want absolutely nothing to do with her, tweedledum, or tweedledee. I stay out of their way, they stay out of my way. It's how it's always been, and I have no intention of changing that.]
{d430} - [You know it was Brittany who almost got Becca an F on that project? She's not going to just stop, either. Not unless we give her a reason to stop.]
{d431} - [You didn't say it was Brittany who wrecked your project.]
{d432} - [I know you don't like her, and I figured you would have just told me I need to avoid her. But you can't just avoid her. She walks on water at Shermont High. Everybody loves her.]
{d433} - [Nobody loves her.]
{d434} - [Except maybe Heather. I swear that girl thinks Brittany is the next Madonna or something.]
{d435} - [What did you have in mind?]
{d436} - [Well, I heard that you have a computer at home, is that right?]
{d437} - [Yeah... why?]
{d438} - [What are you doing after school today?]
{d439} - [Are you okay?]
{d440} - [Huh? Oh, yeah. It's just, um, well honestly, this is my first dance.]
{d441} - [What?]
{d442} - [Yeah. I didn't really do these kind of things at my old school. I mean, I wanted to, I just, well I didn't really have a ton of friends. I more kept to myself, you know?]
{d443} - [Oh.]
{d444} - [Yeah. I mean, that probably makes me sound like some kind of 
dork or something, but-]
{d445} - [No, not at all.]
{d446} - [Just... thanks for asking me.]
{d447} - [You're welcome.]
{d448} - [Care to dance?]
{d449} - [Heather?]
{d450} - [Yes, Brittany?]
{d451} - [Can you remind me what the theme of tonight's dance is?]
{d452} - [Uh, formal?]
{d453} - [Not the dress code, the type of dance it is.]
{d454} - [Oh. Yeah! It's a Sadie Hawkins.]
{d455} - [(back to JIMMY) And what is supposed to happen at a Sadie Hawkins dance?]
{d456} - [(very confidently, to JIMMY) We dance.]
{d457} - [No, you idiot. I mean before the dance. What is supposed to happen before one goes to a Sadie Hawkins Dance.]
{d458} - [We go to Dairy Queen?]
{d459} - [Yeeeaaahh, okay. I'm going to let you two... do whatever it is that you're trying to do, and be literally anywhere else.]
{d460} - [And exactly where do you think you're going, hoser? You're only allowed to be here if a girl from this school invited you.]
{d461} - [So unfortunately for you, your mom doesn't count.]
{d462} - [Can you just let me-]
{d463} - [Sorry, dork brain, rules are rules.]
{d464} - [Jim Jam! I was wondering when you were going to get here. You had me thinking you might go ahead and stand a girl up.]
{d465} - [Wouldn't that be embarrassing? Having no date to the Sadie Hawkins. I can't even imagine. You girls know what I mean.]
{d466} - [Oh. I'm sorry. You two aren't here.. alone.. are you?]
{d467} - [Come on, Jim Jam. You promised me you'd dance with me at least once.]
{d468} - [Let's go, stud!]
{d469} - [She's like, wicked pretty.]
{d470} - [Shut up, Heather!]
{d471} - [Thank you for that. Brittany seems out for blood tonight.]
{d472} - [She's just like that because she thinks she's being stood up.]
{d473} - [Wait, what?]
{d474} - [I may have had a little help pretending to be someone else on a computer, and then convinced her to ask "me" to the dance tonight. That's why she is hovering by the door in the first place. Waiting for a guy with a white suit and a bright red boutonniere to walk in.]
{d475} - [That's actually pretty awful. I mean, if anyone deserves it, it's 
Brittany Maddox, but still. She's going to be mega pissed when she 
finds out.]
{d476} - [I have a feeling she'll be just fine. I said I pretended to be someone else, not that the someone else doesn't actually exist.]
{d477} - [Isn't that the foreign exchange student?]
{d478} - [Ian. Yeah, turns out he thinks she is hilarious or something. I think a lot must get lost in translation.]
{d479} - [Why poke the bear when you can give it what it is really looking for?]
{d480} - [And what's that?]
{d481} - [What we all are looking for. To feel like we're needed.]
{d482} - [I don't think I've ever seen her make that face before.]
{d483} - [You mean smile?]
{d484} - [Yes. Make it stop.]
{d485} - [Still, thank you. I owe you big time.]
{d486} - [Well I know how you are going to repay me.]
{d487} - [And how is that?]
{d488} - [Well we are at a dance. Why don't you show me what you've got.]
{d489} - [Why aren't you two out there dancing?]
{d490} - [That's not really our scene.]
{d491} - [Says who?]
{d492} - [Um... us?]
{d493} - [Come on. Are you telling me you don't want to be out there. Not even a little bit?]
{d494} - [You have the rest of your life to take things so seriously. You are allowed to have a little bit of fun now and again.]
{d495} - [I guess we could let loose a little. It is a dance after all. Right?]
{d496} - [There we go! Come on. Without thinking, if you could do anything you want right now, no matter how crazy, what would that be?]
{d497} - [I.. uh..]
{d498} - [I want to jump up on this table.]
{d499} - [What's stopping you?]
{d500} - [You serious?]
{d501} - [Why not?]
{d502} - [WOOOOOO!]
{d503} - [WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING! GET DOWN FROM THERE!!]
{d504} - [Pretty Rad, huh?]
{d505} - [What's Rad?]
{d506} - [What?]
{d507} - [I asked "What's Rad?"]
{d508} - [You know, "Rad". It's what the kids are all saying. It means, 
Hip, Cool, ( <em>Drawing this one out)</em> "Gnarly".]
{d509} - [Yes, Mr. White. I know what it means. I meant, what is it you think is]
{d510} - ["rad"?]
{d511} - [Oh. Yeah. This. All of this]
{d512} - [. Our dances were never this "hoppin'" were they?]
{d513} - [Our dances?]
{d514} - [Yeah. Our dances. Like when we were back in high school. They were never this rad.]
{d515} - [Mr. White, with all due respect. You do know that I only graduated high school, like, six years ago, right? I've actually danced to this song, in this very gym before.]
{d516} - [I actually think you were even a chaperone at a couple of them.]
{d517} - [Totally.]
{d518} - [Hey, you two! I said two feet apart. Don't make me get out my yardstick!]
{d519} - [Where did Jimmy learn to move like that?]
{d520} - [I have no idea!]
{d521} - [One thing's for sure, I don't think he's going to have any trouble finding a date to prom.]
{d522} - [I swear, if Sara doesn't hurry up and make a move, I might be at the front of that line.]
{d523} - [Seriously?]
{d524} - [What? I have a soft spot for geeks. I mean, I'm your friend aren't I?]
{d525} - [Let's get back out there before someone else steps in.]
{d526} - [You too?]
{d527} - [How's your date going?]
{d528} - [He's so sweet!]
{d529} - [It's all going how you fantasized it would, then?]
{d530} - [Not at all.]
{d531} - [This... This is so much better than some fantasy. This is reality. I think at some point I got so caught up with what could happen, that I lost sight of what I actually wanted to happen.]
{d532} - [Sounds like my work here is done then.]
{d533} - [You're not sticking around? I think Jimmy has started to grow a little fond of you.]
{d534} - [Just Jimmy?]
{d535} - [No. Not just Jimmy.]
{d536} - [I think he'll be just fine.]
{d537} - [And me?]
{d538} - [You're going to be fine too.]
{d539} - [Can't have me sticking around. Gotta let go of that fantasy at some point, right?]
{d540} - [Yeah. I guess so..]
{d541} - [Stick around for a little bit more?]
{d542} - [Not itching to get rid of me just yet?]
{d543} - [Nah. I think this is one fantasy that we can let play out a little longer.]
