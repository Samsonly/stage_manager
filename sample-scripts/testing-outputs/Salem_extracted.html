{d36} - [and her eleven year old cousin, Abigail Williams, would have frequent fits of convulsions and spasms, appearing to be in great pain.]
{d37} - [However, these were not just any random girls. Both of these girls lived in the house of the newly ordained, and highly controversial, minister:]

{d82} - [Following the accusations from the afflicted girls, warrants went out for Tituba, Sarah Good, and Sarah Osborne, and the very next day all three were held for questioning by the local magistrates.Sarah Good, a local homeless woman who was known for wandering door to door with her four year old daughter Dorothy begging for food or shelter, was often seen muttering under her breath when leaving, regardless of the outcome, which led many to believe she was casting spells. During her examination, she claimed innocence, and when the girls in the crowd began to act tormented, she blamed her co-accused Sarah Osborne.Osborne, on the other hand, maintained that she had nothing to do with witchcraft and was confused as to why anyone would claim otherwise. However, one family in Salem Village would disagree with that notion. A few years prior when her husband passed away, he left the land to their two sons. But when she eventually remarried, she kept the land for herself, which greatly angered her late husband's relatives... the Putnam family.But the one who stood out the most out of the trio, was Samuel Parris' slave Tituba. She was liked within the minister's household, and unlike the Sarahs who were named alongside her, the community in general knew very little about her. Although before very long, that would all change. When Tituba was examined in front of a crowd nearly the size of the village itself, she not only admitted to hurting the girls and being a witch, but she swore that both Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, as well as a few others whose names she did not know, were all tormenting the girls]
{d83} - [Magistrates Hathorne and Corwin decided they had enough evidence to charge the three women with witchcraft, and they were all sent to Boston to wait in jail for their trials while the rest of Salem Village began to wonder to themselves just who those other witches she talked about might be.]

As he saw how the young girls behaved, however, he stepped away from his job, refusing to contribute to what he saw as frivolous accusations. To perhaps nobody's surprise but his own, the afflicted girls soon went on to then accuse him of being a witch. Wanting to avoid the ordeal, Willard decided to go on the run. But the idea of a witch on the loose heightened an already tense community, and even with him gone, the girls found ways to cause him trouble. When Willard's cousin-in-law Daniel Wilkins became suddenly sick, the girls seized the opportunity to blame him for that as well. Mercy Lewis claimed to see Willard's apparition hovering over and afflicting him. She then made the bold prediction that if Willard was not apprehended within the next two days, that Wilkins would die from his afflictions.Unfortunately, for both Wilkins and Willard, Mercy's bluff proved to be true and two days later, Wilkins passed away. A new warrant was released for Willard's arrest, and two days later they discovered him hiding out halfway across the colony, tending to one of his properties.

{d256} - [JONATHAN HATHORNE (G. COREY). What did you do then? Did you not give yourself to the Devil?]
{d257} - [No, never in my life.]
{d258} - [JONATHAN HATHORNE (G. COREY). Then what ails these girls?]
{d259} - [I do not know.]
{d260} - [JONATHAN HATHORNE (G. COREY). But what do you think?]
{d261} - [I have no interest in thinking of such things.]
{d262} - [JONATHAN HATHORNE (G. COREY). So you do not think they are bewitched?]
{d263} - [No.]
{d264} - [I do not think they are.]
{d265} - [JONATHAN HATHORNE (G. COREY). Then tell me your thoughts about them.]
{d266} - [I cannot give you my thoughts, for they are only mine when I possess them. If I gave my thoughts, then they would belong to you.]
{d267} - [(to audience) I don't think they liked how I handled the early examination, and I was thrown in jail shortly following that encounter. However, if I thought that by the time I was called for trial they would use more sense, I was sorely mistaken. Behold the undeniable evidence placed upon me...]
{d268} - [JONATHAN HATHORNE (G. COREY). Goody Atkinson, what say you about Goody Martin?]
{d269} - [SARAH ATKINSON (E. PROCTOR). Eighteen years hence, I was visited upon by Goody Martin. She had walked all the way from her home in Amesbury to my own, nine miles away in Newbury. It was a particularly dirty and wet time of year, but when she arrived at my door...]
{d270} - [she was as dry and clean as I was.]
{d271} - [JONATHAN HATHORNE (G. COREY). Goody Martin, how do you explain walking nine miles in such conditions, and yet be as clean as if you had just stepped out your own door.]
{d272} - [I do not enjoy a dirty cloak. Have you ever attempted to get mud and soil out of clean linen?]

{d278} - [MARY WALCOTT (WILDES). I have seen her, but I do not know if she is the one who has hurt me.]
{d279} - [ABIGAIL WILLIAMS (CARRIER). She has hurt me! She has bitten and pinched me.]
{d280} - [ANN PUTNAM JR (GOOD). And I as well. She sits in my grandmother's chair and mocks and torments me.]
{d281} - [JONATHAN HATHORNE (G. COREY). What say you, Goody Nurse?]
{d282} - [The lord knows I have not hurt them. I am an innocent person.]
{d283} - [MARY WALCOTT (WILDES). Rebecca Nurse just appeared before me and stuck me with these pins!]
{d284} - [SARAH CLOYCE (E. PROCTOR). She lies! I just saw her pull those pins from her dress with my own eyes.]
{d285} - [MARY WALCOTT (WILDES). She stood in front of me and told me it was her and not the devil. It is her who hurts me!]
{d286} - [I am as innocent as a newborn and have hurt no one!]
{d287} - [JONATHAN HATHORNE (G. COREY). Yet they accuse you of hurting them, so if you think they are untruthful, then you must look upon them as murders.]
{d288} - [I do think them bewitched, but I cannot help if the devil appears in my image.]
{d289} - [(to audience)  No matter how I responded, Judge Hathorne refused to believe me, and he sent me to jail to await my trial. Thirty-nine brave villagers, including cousins and relatives of Thomas Putnam, signed a petition asking for my release, but it had no effect. Instead I was kept locked up in conditions unsuitable for someone of my age and health for almost a hundred days before my trial.]
{d290} - [JONATHAN HATHORNE (G. COREY). How does the jury find the prisoner?]
{d291} - [THOMAS FISK (HOWE). We the jury find Rebecca Nurse... Not Guilty.]
{d292} - [JONATHAN HATHORNE (G. COREY). Quiet! All of you. Sit in your seats and remain quiet. (to HOWE) Did you say Not Guilty?]
{d293} - [THOMAS FISK (HOWE). I did.]
{d294} - [JONATHAN HATHORNE (G. COREY). Did the jury consider the testimony given in which the accused referred to Goody Hobbs, a confessed witch, in saying "I thought she was one of us?"]
{d295} - [THOMAS FISK (HOWE). If it pleases the honored court, we did.]
{d296} - [JONATHAN HATHORNE (G. COREY). I think you should all take some time to consider it once more.]
{d297} - [The jury reconvened to discuss the matter before coming back to ask me a question.]
{d298} - [JONATHAN HATHORNE (G. COREY). Has the jury re-considered the testimony?]
{d299} - [THOMAS FISK (HOWE). We'd like to ask Goody Nurse a question if we may?]
{d300} - [JONATHAN HATHORNE (G. COREY). Proceed.]
{d301} - [THOMAS FISK (HOWE). Goody Nurse. We'd like to know what it is you meant when you referred to the known witch, Goody Hobbs, as "one of us". Can you explain this to us?]
{d302} - [What no one told them, or that they failed to notice throughout my entire trial, was that at the age of 72, I had lost most of my hearing. I didn't even know that anyone had asked me a question until two days later when my family came to visit me and asked me about it. I thought we were all just waiting.]
{d303} - [JONATHAN HATHORNE (G. COREY). Has the jury finally reached a verdict?]
{d304} - [THOMAS FISK (HOWE). We have. Although we had originally found Rebecca Nurse Not Guilty of witchcraft, the evidence that the honored courtroom encouraged us to review, along with the unsatisfactory response from Goody Nurse when questioned, has led us to re-consider our decision. We, the jury of Essex County find Rebecca Nurse Guilty on all charges of witchcraft.]

Along side them were, Elizabeth Howe, Sarah Wildes, and Sarah Good, whose newborn daughter had also passed a few days after entering the world in a Boston jail cell.]
{d313} - [At this point in the historic events of Salem, less than a third of the total executions had yet to take place. But the seed of doubt that Bridget's politically sanctioned murder had planted quickly grew into public indignation by the way Rebecca Nurse had been treated.]

{d320} - [In addition to the way we were treated in the jail and courtroom, I had also recently discovered that Sheriff George Corwin, the favorite nephew of Judge Corwin, had ransacked my entire estate.]
{d321} - [He went about and stole anything that was not attached to the property. Even going as far as dumping out all of our food, ale, and supplies that he could not take with him just so that my family couldn't use them. My eleven children were left with a home empty of food or firewood.]

{d323} - [[Salem Jail]]
{d324} - [I had also learned that my son, as well as the family members of Martha Carrier, had been tortured by the Sheriff in an attempt to elicit a guilty plea. Only when a man who was more merciful than the rest took pity upon was my son, was he released and sent home with marks all over his body and blood dripping from his nose.]
{d325} - [In a desperate attempt for mercy, I wrote a letter to a number of influential ministers from Boston, begging for them to send help, or at the very least for them to attend the trials so that some sort of justice could be restored.No reply ever came, so the trials and executions continued as planned.]
{d326} - [Within the next couple of weeks, six more innocent souls, including myself, my wife Elizabeth, Martha Carrier, George Jacobs Sr, John Willard, and George Burroughs would be condemned to be hanged, effectively doubling the total number of victims.]

After seeing how his wife had been treated during her trial, Giles had no interest in participating in what he had come to believe was a mockery of justice.]
{d339} - [So when the judges proceeded to ask if he would accept the terms of the trial, Giles refused to respond. The court was at a loss. Their own tradition stated that without his consent, they could not proceed with a trial.]
{d340} - [However, Thomas Putnam stepped up and reminded the court of an old English law which outlined a method for dealing with such a situation.]
{d341} - [The technique included laying an individual down on the ground before placing a wooden plank across the length of their body. Then they would add one stone after another, stopping only to ask the victim if they were willing to give their consent.]
{d342} - [Giles Corey, at the age of 81, withstood this torture for hours. When asked once more if he was willing to stand trial, he had two words for Sheriff Corwin: More Weight.]

{d349} - [With eight new names added to the books, it was the deadliest day of the Salem Witch Trials. But perhaps the most surprising victim of that fateful afternoon was the Court of Oyer and Terminer itself.]
