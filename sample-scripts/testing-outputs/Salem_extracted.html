{d1} - ["Thou Shalt Not Suffer a Witch to Live." Exodus 22:18.]
{d2} - [Did you know that when that verse was first translated into ancient Greek over two thousand years ago, it may have actually meant to warn against poisoners, not witches?]
{d3} - [Nothing about magic and no mention at all about secret compacts with the Devil.]
{d4} - [I wonder how those whose lives were irrevocably impacted by centuries of witch hunts and persecutions would react to that little piece of trivia.]
{d5} - [Light Box: Out]
{d6} - [In fact, it wasn't until around the time the bible was first translated into English that the idea of witches as lost souls who convene with the Devil for nefarious means began to emerge.]
{d7} - [Coincidence?]
{d8} - [For centuries, witches have been scattered throughout the stories and histories of Western Civilization.]
{d9} - [From fairy tales and plays of old, to even modern books and films, we've all grown up with an idea of what a witch may look like, or how she might behave.]
{d10} - [Many of you right this very moment might even be thinking about another time you witnessed three seemingly innocent witches come together on a stage.]
{d11} - ["Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble!"]
{d12} - [But when our families first came over to America, there were no best selling children's books about family friendly witches.]
{d13} - [You couldn't identify a witch by whether or not her skin was green.]
{d14} - [And even the Brothers Grimm were still a couple of hundred years in the future.]
{d15} - [When we first crossed the ocean and settled into our New England towns and villages, only one book made the journey.]
{d16} - [The Bible.]
{d17} - [And that book had a very clear stance on witches. Light Box: ["Thou Shalt Not Suffer a Witch to Live" Exodus 22:18]]
{d18} - ["Thou Shalt Not Suffer a Witch to Live."]
{d19} - [Title Box: Out Light Box: Out]
{d20} - [There was a dramatic cultural shift in the way suspected witches were accused and dealt with in the century between the European Witch Hunts and the events that took place across Salem in 1692.]
{d21} - [Although tens of thousands of Europeans had been hanged or burned at the stake, the associated fear and hysteria had begun to fade by the time many made the long journey to the new colonies.]
{d22} - [However, without having any solutions to the abundant threats they faced in the new world, many searched for guidance and advice in the superstitions of old.]
{d23} - [And what better scapegoat than the Devil himself, or those working on his behalf, when your livestock dies overnight, or someone you care for comes down with a new and mysterious illness?]
{d24} - [<em>TRANSITION TO:</em>]
{d25} - [Towards the end of January, 1692, two young girls in Salem Village began to show signs of physical distress. For weeks, nine year old Betty Parris,]
{d26} - [and her eleven year old cousin, Abigail Williams, would have frequent fits of convulsions and spasms, appearing to be in great pain.]
{d27} - [However, these were not just any random girls. Both of these girls lived in the house of the newly ordained, and highly controversial, minister:]
{d28} - [Samuel Parris.]
{d29} - [Many in Salem felt cheated by the rushed process in finding their new minister.]
{d30} - [Unsure if he was the right fit, the village committee decided to vote against providing firewood for him and his family.]
{d31} - [Leaving the Parris household to fend for themselves in the brutal New England winter, and causing Parris to resent the very community he was tasked with leading.]
{d32} - [But the symptoms were getting worse for his daughter and niece, and he had to get to the bottom of it.]
{d33} - [And soon, a doctor was sent for, in order to weigh in on the mysterious illness.]
{d34} - [Do you have any idea what ails them, doctor?]
{d35} - [Whatever it is, the only thing I can be certain of is that it is not natural in origin.]
{d36} - [Doctor?]
{d37} - [Reverend, I fear that the cause of the girls convulsions may well stem from some sort of... sorcery.]
{d38} - [I believe them to be afflicted by witchcraft.]
{d39} - [Do you see who does this to you?]
{d40} - [I know not, father.]
{d41} - [The fits of both young girls continued to grow worse, and before long, two more girls became afflicted.]
{d42} - [The seventeen year old niece and housemaid of Dr. Griggs, Elizabeth Hubbard, who had likely heard about the afflictions from her guardian,]
{d43} - [As well as twelve year old Ann Putnam Jr, the eldest child of Thomas Putnam and his wife-]
{d44} - [Ann Putnam Sr. Both of whom were among the most prominent advocates for Reverend Parris and his parish.]
{d45} - [Ann, please tell me who does this to you. Who hurts you and torments you with the devil's aide?]
{d46} - [She blinds me with her magic.]
{d47} - [Abigail, please. You need to give me a name. I cannot help you or my daughter if I do not know who is responsible.]
{d48} - [She doesn't want me to know who she is.]
{d49} - [She? So it is a witch?]
{d50} - [Elizabeth, I've always taken care of you since your parents passed, and I always will, but I need you to tell me now. Who afflicts you?]
{d51} - [I can't tell, uncle. But she hurts me so. I feel her stabbing me with pins all over.]
{d52} - [I've had enough of this, Betty. Now tell me: Whose face do you see when the fits come?]
{d53} - [Tituba...]
{d54} - [Tituba? Our Tituba does this to you? Is that who you see?]
{d55} - [...yes.]
{d56} - [Is there anyone else, Betty?]
{d57} - [Does anyone else afflict you, or does the responsibility of these despicable actions rest solely on Tituba?]
{d58} - [It's not only Tituba.]
{d59} - [Who? Who else does this to you?]
{d60} - [Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne. <em>G. COREY, J. PROCTOR, and E. PROCTOR all react to finally hearing names from their charges. Then they exit.</em>]
{d61} - [To spare his daughter, he sent her to Salem Town to stay with a distant relative and to avoid what he knew was on the horizon.]
{d62} - [As fear spread throughout the village, Samuel Parris began to notice that all of a sudden, the seats in his parish were filled, and there was no longer talk of trying to force him out.]
{d63} - [However, if it had come out that Tituba, the reverend's own slave, was the sole cause of all of the sorcery, things would have changed quite quickly for the polarizing minister.]
{d64} - [Fortunately for him, his daughter and niece, as well as the other two afflicted girls, all soon named the other two women, officially kicking off what would become the foundation for the Salem Witch Trials with three accused witches.]
{d65} - [<em>TRANSITION TO:</em>]
{d66} - [Following the accusations from the afflicted girls, warrants went out for Tituba, Sarah Good, and Sarah Osborne, and the very next day all three were held for questioning by the local magistrates.Sarah Good, a local homeless woman who was known for wandering door to door with her four year old daughter Dorothy begging for food or shelter, was often seen muttering under her breath when leaving, regardless of the outcome, which led many to believe she was casting spells. During her examination, she claimed innocence, and when the girls in the crowd began to act tormented, she blamed her co-accused Sarah Osborne.Osborne, on the other hand, maintained that she had nothing to do with witchcraft and was confused as to why anyone would claim otherwise. However, one family in Salem Village would disagree with that notion. A few years prior when her husband passed away, he left the land to their two sons. But when she eventually remarried, she kept the land for herself, which greatly angered her late husband's relatives... the Putnam family.But the one who stood out the most out of the trio, was Samuel Parris' slave Tituba. She was liked within the minister's household, and unlike the Sarahs who were named alongside her, the community in general knew very little about her. Although before very long, that would all change. When Tituba was examined in front of a crowd nearly the size of the village itself, she not only admitted to hurting the girls and being a witch, but she swore that both Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, as well as a few others whose names she did not know, were all tormenting the girls]
{d67} - [Magistrates Hathorne and Corwin decided they had enough evidence to charge the three women with witchcraft, and they were all sent to Boston to wait in jail for their trials while the rest of Salem Village began to wonder to themselves just who those other witches she talked about might be.

{d69} - [The Putnams were not the type to let such an enticing opportunity simply pass them by.]
{d70} - [But this was quickly becoming far too important of an operation to place in the hands of just one twelve year old girl,]
{d71} - [So they also recruited their orphaned maid Mercy Lewis to assist them.]
{d72} - [And with the community fearful of who else might be working with the devil,]
{d73} - [Thomas Putnam and his family went to work.]
{d74} - [It was a good time to be on the side of the Putnams.]
{d75} - [Something I wish my wife Martha would have considered before publicly declaring the afflicted to be a bunch of foolish girls starving for attention.]
{d76} - [Hush, Giles. What are you even doing over here? You're supposed to be over there playing Ezekiel Cheever so you can verify what the Putnams say happened.]
{d77} - [Oh! That's this scene?]
{d78} - [ALL transition into their scenes. M. COREY is busy folding linens on her side, while the rest begin on the other side. Lights dim on Corey side)]
{d79} - [We will be going over to the Corey household shortly to inquire about her actions.]
{d80} - [When she attacked you this morning, can you remember what it was that she was wearing? If she is wearing the same when we call upon her, it will prove her guilt.]
{d81} - [I could not tell. When she first came to me, she blinded me so that I could not see her or what she was wearing, but she told me her name. She told me it was Goody Corey and that she'd be back to hurt me again!]
{d82} - [I am not a witch.]
{d83} - [Uh.. E-excuse me?]
{d84} - [That is why you are here, is it not? To accuse me of being a witch like those three poor women you all paraded through the village last week?]
{d85} - [Those, women, were conspiring with the devil to torment my daughter. As well as the daughter and niece of our minister, I might add.]
{d86} - [The only thing afflicting those young girls is a bad case of wanting to get out of their housework. You and I both know that.]
{d87} - [Are you saying that my daughter is lying, Goody Corey?]
{d88} - [Aye.]
{d89} - [I assure you tha-]
{d90} - [Oh drop the act, Thomas. We both know that you don't have any evidence to formally make an accusation because no such evidence exists.]
{d91} - [There are other ways of determining guilt.]
{d92} - [Are there now?]
{d93} - [Okay, then. If I have been attacking your daughter as you suggest, what is it that I was wearing when she saw me? I doubt she could answer such a question.]
{d94} - [Excuse me, Goody Corey, but why would you ask such a question?]
{d95} - [Because if she could tell you what I was wearing all the way back at the Putnam farm, then you would know that I had been there. But since I highly doubt she could know such a thing, I am not worried.]
{d96} - [You should be, Goody Corey.]
{d97} - [And why is that?]
{d98} - [Because young Ann did say you came to her this very morning.]
{d99} - [And she said that you knew we'd ask what you were wearing, so you blinded her!]
{d100} - [Then how did she know it was I?]
{d101} - [She said you told her so.]
{d102} - [Goodman Putnam, if you think me a witch, then you are the blind one. The eyes of all those in Salem who think so are kept closed. But I will open them.]
{d103} - [<em>TRANSITION TO:</em>]
{d104} - [With Martha Corey, two other names were supplied by the Putnam family that week. Dorothy Good, the four year old daughter of now imprisoned Sarah, was questioned and then arrested when Ann Jr and Mary Walcott claimed that she acted like a deranged animal, and that her apparition would bite and scratch them.And soon, news would reach me at my home that another name provided by the Putnam clan was none other than my own, Rebecca Nurse. The most absurd part of it all, is that no one even knows who it was who first mentioned my name.Ann Putnam Jr and Mercy Lewis both claimed that it was Ann's mother who told them to accuse me. Whereas Ann Sr told everyone that her daughter had provided my name.Despite the confusion about how I was initially accused, more would join in and claim that I was afflicting them. I never stood a chance. Shadow Box: [Proctor Household] However, as more and more girls throughout the village became afflicted, not everyone in the community was so quick to believe their stories.John Proctor, a local farmer whose own maid had begun to have fits, was heard telling his neighbor that he thought that the girls should all be hanged for the lies they were spreading.]

{d123} - [After the events that occurred during the examination of Elizabeth Proctor, the group of girls headed by Ann Putnam Jr and Abigail Williams became known as the "Visionary Girls".]
{d124} - [And by the first couple weeks of May, these visionary girls went on to accuse dozens more throughout Salem and beyond.]
{d125} - [Nearby towns and villages had started hearing all about the witches of Salem, and the brave young girls who stood up to them.]
{d126} - [So whenever someone was taken ill without any known origin, witchcraft was quickly assumed to be the cause.]
{d127} - [The reputation of the visionary girls led the leaders of neighboring communities to send word, asking if they would come visit and lend their talents to root out witches.]
{d128} - [And by using local gossip, town history, and the reputations of those who lived nearby, names were quickly provided.]
{d129} - [And so while more people were still being questioned and imprisoned in Salem Village, other communities quickly joined in by sending their own accused to Boston in order to await trial.]

{d143} - [Whereas others found themselves guilty of perhaps the most scandalous offense of all... Standing in the way of the Putnam family. A lesson Rebecca Nurse had to learn the hard way:]
{d144} - [I had never done a single thing to the Putnam family. But they had been in power struggles with my husband, as well as land battles with my brothers. Yet it was the women in my family who paid the price.]
{d145} - [Soon after my arrest, two of my sister's were also accused. My sister Mary Easty-]
{d146} - [Would be tried and found guilty less than a month after Rebecca. Our other sister Sarah Cloyce was also jailed, but she would eventually live to see the end of the trials. The Putnams didn't stop with just us though. They even went after another relation: Elizabeth Howe.]
{d147} - [I had been in the middle of my own land dispute against a neighboring family when their daughter became ill. Soon after, I was accused of witchcraft since it was believed to run in families, even though I was only the niece by law of Rebecca, Mary, and Sarah.]
{d148} - [And then there was the wicked Sarah Wildes:]
{d149} - [My biggest mistake was marrying a man just seven months after his wife had died. His late wife... a member of the Putnams.]
{d150} - [One by one the outcasts, the brave, and the enemies of those in power were accused, examined, and sent to jail..]
{d151} - [It was during this time that the first victim of the Salem Witch trials lost their life. Sarah Osborne, one of the original three to be accused, died in prison while awaiting trial. <em>TRANSITION TO:</em>]
{d152} - [At about the same time that the innocent prisoners witnessed the first death from their group, scared villagers believed they witnessed the first murder by a witch against a victim.John Willard had been a constable tasked with the job of bringing in accused witches for examinations. As he saw how the young girls behaved, however, he stepped away from his job, refusing to contribute to what he saw as frivolous accusations. To perhaps nobody's surprise but his own, the afflicted girls soon went on to then accuse him of being a witch. Wanting to avoid the ordeal, Willard decided to go on the run. But the idea of a witch on the loose heightened an already tense community, and even with him gone, the girls found ways to cause him trouble. When Willard's cousin-in-law Daniel Wilkins became suddenly sick, the girls seized the opportunity to blame him for that as well. Mercy Lewis claimed to see Willard's apparition hovering over and afflicting him. She then made the bold prediction that if Willard was not apprehended within the next two days, that Wilkins would die from his afflictions.Unfortunately, for both Wilkins and Willard, Mercy's bluff proved to be true and two days later, Wilkins passed away. A new warrant was released for Willard's arrest, and two days later they discovered him hiding out halfway across the colony, tending to one of his properties. He was immediately examined and sent to prison for the murder of Daniel Wilkins. Shadow Box: Out <em>TRANSITION TO</em> :]

{d154} - [The issue of whether or not to allow testimony including supernatural evidence into the trials.]
{d155} - [But the magistrates and residents of Salem and throughout the colony had already put a lot of weight on the testimony of those who claimed to have visions or see apparitions.]
{d156} - [And to ignore it entirely would have led to most of the cases being dismissed before the trials even started.]

{d243} - [If it pleases the honored court, we did.]
{d244} - [I think you should all take some time to consider it once more.]
{d245} - [The jury reconvened to discuss the matter before coming back to ask me a question.]
{d246} - [Has the jury re-considered the testimony?]
{d247} - [We'd like to ask Goody Nurse a question if we may?]
{d248} - [Proceed.]
{d249} - [Goody Nurse. We'd like to know what it is you meant when you referred to the known witch, Goody Hobbs, as "one of us". Can you explain this to us?]
{d250} - [What no one told them, or that they failed to notice throughout my entire trial, was that at the age of 72, I had lost most of my hearing. I didn't even know that anyone had asked me a question until two days later when my family came to visit me and asked me about it. I thought we were all just waiting.]
{d251} - [Has the jury finally reached a verdict?]
{d252} - [We have. Although we had originally found Rebecca Nurse Not Guilty of witchcraft, the evidence that the honored courtroom encouraged us to review, along with the unsatisfactory response from Goody Nurse when questioned, has led us to re-consider our decision. We, the jury of Essex County find Rebecca Nurse Guilty on all charges of witchcraft.]
{d253} - [<em>TRANSITION TO:</em>]
{d254} - [...having condemned us already before our trials, being so much incensed and engaged against us by the Devil, makes us bold to beg and implore your...]
{d255} - [(to audience)  Oh.]
{d256} - [Um.]
{d257} - [I apologize for that. You were probably expecting one of them]
{d258} - [to keep this whole thing going, but... well... the truth is that we've reached the end of their stories.On July 19th, 1692, Susannah Martin and Rebecca Nurse, were hanged in Salem Village. Along side them were, Elizabeth Howe, Sarah Wildes, and Sarah Good, whose newborn daughter had also passed a few days after entering the world in a Boston jail cell. At this point in the historic events of Salem, less than a third of the total executions had yet to take place. But the seed of doubt that Bridget's politically sanctioned murder had planted quickly grew into public indignation by the way Rebecca Nurse had been treated. With nearly two hundred people imprisoned, and a flawless conviction record of six for six, the Court of Oyer and Terminer plowed ahead without hesitation.]
{d259} - [<em>TRANSITION TO:</em>]
{d260} - [In addition to the way we were treated in the jail and courtroom, I had also recently discovered that Sheriff George Corwin, the favorite nephew of Judge Corwin, had ransacked my entire estate. He went about and stole anything that was not attached to the property. Even going as far as dumping out all of our food, ale, and supplies that he could not take with him just so that my family couldn't use them. My eleven children were left with a home empty of food or firewood. Shadow Box: [Salem Jail] I had also learned that my son, as well as the family members of Martha Carrier, had been tortured by the Sheriff in an attempt to elicit a guilty plea. Only when a man who was more merciful than the rest took pity upon was my son, was he released and sent home with marks all over his body and blood dripping from his nose. In a desperate attempt for mercy, I wrote a letter to a number of influential ministers from Boston, begging for them to send help, or at the very least for them to attend the trials so that some sort of justice could be restored.No reply ever came, so the trials and executions continued as planned. Within the next couple of weeks, six more innocent souls, including myself, my wife Elizabeth, Martha Carrier, George Jacobs Sr, John Willard, and George Burroughs would be condemned to be hanged, effectively doubling the total number of victims. Shadow Box: Out]
{d261} - [<em>TRANSITION TO:</em>]
{d262} - [Despite being found guilty, I was given a temporary reprieve due to the fact I was pregnant. The rest of my group, including my husband, weren't so lucky.]
{d263} - [By this point in the trials, most of the community seemed split on how to proceed. Serious doubts had been raised about the way things were being handled, yet many were afraid to speak up about their concerns out of fear of being accused themselves. Letters from throughout the colony were sent to the Governor pleading with him to intercede, but they continued to go unanswered as those who were currently in charge of the trials continued to feel empowered by their successes and began to seem invincible. <em>TRANSITION TO:</em>]
{d264} - [The next to feel the brunt of their wrath was Giles Corey. Finally, after spending over 150 days in prison, he was finally given his day in court. After seeing how his wife had been treated during her trial, Giles had no interest in participating in what he had come to believe was a mockery of justice. So when the judges proceeded to ask if he would accept the terms of the trial, Giles refused to respond. The court was at a loss. Their own tradition stated that without his consent, they could not proceed with a trial. However, Thomas Putnam stepped up and reminded the court of an old English law which outlined a method for dealing with such a situation. The technique included laying an individual down on the ground before placing a wooden plank across the length of their body. Then they would add one stone after another, stopping only to ask the victim if they were willing to give their consent. Giles Corey, at the age of 81, withstood this torture for hours. When asked once more if he was willing to stand trial, he had two words for Sheriff Corwin: More Weight.]

{d266} - [<em>TRANSITION TO:</em>]
{d267} - [News of the torture of Giles Corey sent shockwaves throughout the village, but another group, including his own wife Martha, were already set to be executed just two days later. On September 22nd, 1692, eight more victims of the witch-hunt, Mary Easty, Martha Corey, Ann Pudeator, Samuel Wardwell, Mary Parker, Alice Parker, Wilmot Redd and Margaret Scott were driven out to Gallows Hill and executed in front of Salem village. With eight new names added to the books, it was the deadliest day of the Salem Witch Trials. But perhaps the most surprising victim of that fateful afternoon was the Court of Oyer and Terminer itself.]
{d268} - [As more and more complaints of disgust made their way to those in Boston, someone finally decided to take a stand.]
{d269} - [One week later, Governor Phips orders that supernatural evidence would no longer allowed,]
{d270} - [Effectively rendering most of the accusations against the over 150 people still waiting in jail useless.]
{d271} - [And by the end of October, Phips put a stop to any further arrests of suspected witches throughout the colonies]
{d272} - [Despite this limitation, the new court still managed to find three more woman guilty of witchcraft,]
{d273} - [and in January, Chief Justice Stoughton signed the death warrant for the newly condemned,]
{d274} - [as well as those such as Elizabeth Proctor who were previously sentenced but still waiting their execution.]
{d275} - [Finally, almost a full year after the first warrant was issued for three innocent women in the small village of Salem, all that had been accused were finally released.]
{d276} - [In a tragic case of symmetry, the last person released from jail was the same who kicked off the entire hysteria.]
{d277} - [Tituba had previously renounced her claims about witchcraft and later admitted that Parris told her that he would leave her to rot in jail if she didn't keep the lies going.]
{d278} - [A promise that he would keep. She was eventually sold to an unknown family who agreed to pay for her court fees after Parris refused to do so a year later.]
{d279} - [Accusers and accused alike would spend decades living in the same communities as each other, attending the same churches, and voting on the same committees, all without anyone officially taking responsibility for what had happened.]
{d280} - [All except one young woman.]
{d281} - [Almost two decades after the events of Salem, Ann Putnam Jr decided to break the silence on what had occurred, offering an apology for her part in the events.]
{d282} - [She was the only afflicted to ever do so. <em>TRANSITION TO:</em>]
{d283} - ["I, Ann Putnam, desire to be humbled before God for that sad and humbling providence that befell my father's family in the year about '92; that I, then being in my childhood, should, by such a providence of God, be made an instrument for the accusing of several persons of a grievous crime, whereby their lives were taken away from them, whom now I have just grounds and good reason to believe they were innocent persons..."]
{d284} - [<em>TRANSITION TO:</em>]
{d285} - ["Innocent persons."]
{d286} - [Those innocent persons were Sarah Osborne, Roger Toothaker,]
{d287} - [Bridget Bishop,]
{d288} - [Sarah and Mercy Good,]
{d289} - [Rebecca Nurse,]
{d290} - [Susannah Martin,]
{d291} - [Sarah Wildes,]

{d300} - [Alice Parker, Ann Pudeator, Margaret Scott,]
{d301} - [Wilmot Redd, Samuel Wardwell, Mary Parker,]
{d302} - [Ann Foster, and Lydia Dustin.]
{d303} - [Twenty Five "innocent persons" would lose their lives in a nine month time period.]
{d304} - [Nineteen were hanged at the gallows.]
{d305} - [Four were left to die in a jail cell that they never belonged in.]
{d306} - [And two were tortured to death all in an attempt to extract the guilt for a crime that was fabricated for no reason other than a failed attempt to grab power for those who felt wronged by their community in the past. Power that was never obtained.]
{d307} - [Only time would eventually allow our loved ones to continue forward where we could not, and even perhaps learn how to forgive those who had wronged us.]
{d308} - [..I was a cause, with others, of so sad a calamity to them and their families; for which cause I desire to lie in the dust, and earnestly beg forgiveness of God, and from all those unto whom I have given just cause of sorrow and offense."]
