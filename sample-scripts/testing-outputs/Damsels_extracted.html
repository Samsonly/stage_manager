{d4} - [No, not "\]
{d5} - [Do you want to hear how it ends or not?]
{d6} - [Fine. But if this turns into another one of those "creepy stranger kisses passed out girl and saves her life" stories, I'm throwing that book in the fire and sleeping warmly tonight.]
{d7} - [No, no. It's nothing like that.]
{d8} - [It better not be. 
\]
{d9} - ["Stumbled on some brush."]
{d10} - [How is that any better?! Do you really not see anything wrong with this? Every single one of these stories! If they aren't selling the daughter, or locking her away, they're nearly killing her off and having some blundering fool save the day. Half the time not even on purpose. They just, in this case literally, stumble over the way to save the day.]
{d11} - [You're the one who keeps asking me to read these to you. I don't know why you do that if you don't want to hear them.]

{d18} - [But you said I could have all the sheep I wanted. 
\]
{d19} - [I can't quite say "happy" is what I am feeling at the moment.]
{d20} - [Good. You know why? Because literally not a single person within a hundred miles cares if you are happy. The only reason you are not in one of those cages with the rest of the men of the kingdom is because you are the Queen's only nephew. I was asked to spare you, but never once did "happy" enter the conversation.]
{d21} - [I understand.]
{d22} - [Better. Now I need you to run an errand for me.]
{d23} - [Anything!]
{d24} - [I appear to need a few ingredients. I could use some rosemary... 
\]
{d25} - [It sure does. Remember that brat I poisoned in the woods the other day? Take care of the body. I want no evidence I was ever there.]

\]
{d84} - [Looks like the wolf found his next victim.

\]
{d86} - [I'm sorry. I'm not the heroic type.

{d96} - [A f-fr-frog.

{d97} - [Not at all. Frogs are for stew. You wouldn't taste very well I'd imagine. I think something from the rodent family would be much more fitting for you. 
\]
{d98} - [No. No. Not at all. Just preparing dinner. 
\]
{d99} - [Do you dare lecture me on my Kingdom? I don't tell you how much Newt's Tail to put in your.. recipes, do I?

{d100} - [Then why don't we each stick to what we know best, shall we?]

{d103} - [Impossible.]
{d104} - [You keep saying that. Yet, when I checked on it this afternoon, it still seems to think Snow White is the fairest in the land.]
{d105} - [Snow White?]
{d106} - [Yes. You know, the one you promised me just last night that had been taken out of the picture... permanently?]
{d107} - [Oh, \]
{d108} - [Yes! \]
{d109} - [Oh?]
{d110} - [Oh. What do you know of this new "Rose" girl parading through the woods like she owns the place?]
{d111} - [She's nothing. You don't need to worry about her even a little. She'll be taken care of, trust me.]
{d112} - [That's just the thing. I don't trust you. I didn't before any of this, and I surely don't now. You're a necessity and nothing more. But if you can't even do this one little thing for me, then I am not so sure you're even that.]
{d113} - [But Your Ma-]
{d114} - [But NOTHING! \]
{d115} - [I think it came from over here. 
\]
{d116} - [Bread.]
{d117} - [Excuse me?]
{d118} - [I thought it looked a little out of place. It's bread!]
{d119} - [And what if you were wrong? It could have been a poisonous mushroom or something! 
\]
{d120} - [What?]
{d121} - [Look, it's a trail of breadcrumbs!]
{d122} - [Why would there be a trail of breadcrumbs in the middle of the forest? 
\]
{d123} - [What are you doing? 
\]
{d124} - [Woah, woah.. calm down. We heard a scream and came looking for you.]
{d125} - [Oh, yeah. That was me. I thought I saw something back there, which made me scream, and then I was afraid that my scream would draw it closer, so I hid, and then I heard you coming and thought maybe you were 
her, so I-]
{d126} - ["Her" who? 
\]
{d127} - [Oh...]
{d128} - [You've seen her? 
\]
{d129} - [You can call me Red.]
{d130} - [Red. Yes. We're actually looking to find the witch. We think she may have something to do with Snow's missing friends.]
{d131} - [Her basement is full of people.]
{d132} - [You were in the witch's basement and made it out? 
\]
{d133} - [I really wasn't down there long. My brother Hansel and I stumbled across her house when we were trying to find our way home.I saw that there were a bunch of people locked up downstairs, and I knew we needed to get out of there as fast as we could, but then she found us. We turned to run, and I didn't stop running until I could no longer breathe. I thought we had made it until I looked around and noticed that I was alone. Hansel must have been caught by her, and I didn't even notice.]
{d134} - [Why didn't you go back in for him?]
{d135} - [I wanted to! But by the time I noticed, I was lost! I've been trying to find my way back ever since.]
{d136} - [How long ago was that?]
{d137} - [Three days ago.]
{d138} - [And you've been out here for that long, lost, by yourself? 
\]
{d139} - [\]
{d140} - [We don't want any trouble.]
{d141} - [Well that's unfortunate, because trouble is exactly what you're about to get.]
{d142} - [What do you want.]
{d143} - [So many things. Originally, I only came for a little snack. I heard that there was a nice tasty treat asleep in the meadow. imagine my disappointment to only find a half eaten apple instead. But now... 
\]
{d144} - [Ah, the better to see you with.]
{d145} - [See, I would think it makes for a bigger target. 
\]
{d146} - [\]
{d147} - [No. I don't.]
{d148} - [Look, there is a window up there. It's too high though.]
{d149} - [Maybe we can climb a tree and cross over on a branch?]
{d150} - [Too far. They don't reach.]
{d151} - [Maybe if I can get enough of my helpers, they can take us one by one? 
\]
{d152} - [I can't hear anything over the noise of those flying rodents. 
\]
{d153} - [Hello! Is ther-]
{d154} - [How are you all doing on this beautiful day?]
{d155} - [Good. But we're in a bit of trouble down here. Is there an-]
{d156} - [Wow. I love your hair. I've always wanted to grow mine long.]
{d157} - [\]
{d158} - [Oh for fairy's sake. Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair! 
\]
{d159} - [Evil Witch sent a murderous wolf to eat us.]
{d160} - [I see. I see. \]
{d161} - [Because she's a witch.]
{d162} - [Right. Gotcha. \]
{d163} - [Yeah. Most witches are pretty big on the whole torture and killing thing. It's sorta what they're known for.]
{d164} - [Well, not \]
{d165} - [I guess I don't know about all of them. I've only met one, but she's tried to kill me quite a few times.]
{d166} - [One tried to eat me and my brother. 
\]
{d167} - [That can't be true.]
{d168} - [It is. I think it-]
{d169} - [Not the wolf. The witch. The witch I know would never try to kill anyone. She is nice to everyone.]
{d170} - [Have you seen her around anyone else?]
{d171} - [Well n-]
{d172} - [Rapunzel, have you ever asked why you're locked up here? All by yourself?]
{d173} - [To keep me safe.]
{d174} - [Safe from what?]
{d175} - [I don't... know.]
{d176} - [I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but your friend, the witch? She stole you from your parents when you were a kid, and hid you up here to punish them.]
{d177} - [No. That can't be. She wouldn't do that.]
{d178} - [If we want to get out of the forest before it gets dark, we need to leave.]
{d179} - [How will we get back down.]
{d180} - [The same way we came up.]
{d181} - [\]
{d182} - [I don't know if that's such a good idea.]
{d183} - [Suit yourself!]
{d184} - [Trust us. We'll show you. 
\]
{d185} - [Okay, now that she is coming too, how will she get down.]
{d186} - [Well we can tie one part of her hair here... 
\]
{d187} - [\]
{d188} - [Those girls you sent me after.\]
{d189} - [Rose?]
{d190} - [\]
{d191} - [No idea. \]
{d192} - [And why in fairy's name would she do that?]
{d193} - [Because she wants me to be happy. She said it herself.\]
{d194} - [Woah! Are you okay? What are you running from? 
\]
{d195} - [Did you see anyone else there?]
{d196} - [Yes, but only one. He freed me.]
{d197} - [What did he look like?]
{d198} - [Was he a dwarf? 
\]
{d199} - [You have to help him! He set me free, but just as we were leaving, the witch returned, and he stayed behind to save me.]
{d200} - [Of course he did.]
{d201} - [Will you help him? Before she turns him into a frog?]
{d202} - [Can you show us the way, and how to get in?]
{d203} - [I think so.]
{d204} - [\]
{d205} - [Mine as well. We're almost there already.]
{d206} - [Do you know how to get to the basement.\]
{d207} - [Alright then. Let's do this! 
\]
{d208} - [Here it is. This is where she kept me locked up for the last few days. Oh, and there he is, I hope he is okay!

{d214} - [Okay! Okay! I'll do it. Just... give me a second. 
\]
{d215} - [What is it with you and kissing frogs? That is so gross!]
{d216} - [And you yell at me for eating an apple I found by a tree. This somehow seems much worse. 
\]
{d217} - [I really should have stayed in my tower.]
{d218} - [Okay, can we all just pretend that didn't happen, for like one second?

{d223} - [Then you'll let me and my friends go?]
{d224} - [I'm sorry, I can't do that.]
{d225} - [But why not?]
{d226} - [Well your friends broke into my home. That's not a nice thing to do, is it? I can't just let them go away without being punished. How ever would they learn their lesson? 
\]
{d227} - [But see, that's where you're mistaken.]
{d228} - [I am?]
{d229} - [I have no intention of letting you go either. 
\]
{d230} - [Which one?]
{d231} - [Snow. I'll deal with \]
{d232} - [If your nephew is to be believed, she is apparently tunneling a hole in my basement as we speak. 
\]
{d233} - [That's what you want, right? Well, you're never going to be that.]
{d234} - [Is that so?]
{d235} - [It is. You'll never be the fairest, or the most clever, or the most loved. 
\]
{d236} - [Not this. Isn't that what your mirror keeps telling you? 
\]
{d237} - [Who are you calling worthless?! 
\]
{d238} - [\]
{d239} - [You can't possibly be- 
\]
{d240} - [That's it?]
{d241} - [Well it's a start. Then you could use your position to start empowering those around you instead of trying to get rid of them. 
\]
{d242} - [You need to start with those who have your best interest in mind. 
\]
{d243} - [My pleasure.]
{d244} - [You know what needs to happen now, right?]
{d245} - [\]
{d246} - [Come on, Rose, you need to wake up! Ah! She rises!]
{d247} - [\]
{d248} - [Well good morning to you too. Looks like you had a little more adventure in you after all. 
\]
{d249} - [Was.. Was I just asleep?]
{d250} - [You were. Although I would have guessed a coma from how hard it was to wake you. 
\]
{d251} - [Why did you pinch me?]
{d252} - [That's what you do to wake someone up, isn't it?]
{d253} - [\]
{d254} - [What was that?]
{d255} - [Nothing.]
{d256} - [Well get up will you. I'll be downstairs waiting for you.]
{d257} - [\]
{d258} - [\]
{d259} - [\]
{d260} - [Well come tell me all about it.
