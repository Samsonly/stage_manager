{c2} {d2} {i2}\ Snow White's dead body to a random dude in the woods? 
{c3} {d3} 
{c4} {d4} {i3}\ " prince, "\ {i4}\ " prince. And the dwarfs didn't even know if he was the real deal. They just took his word and \ {i5}\ him their friend's body. 
\ {i6}\ ROSE. What?!

\ 
\ \ GRANDMOTHER. All right. That's enough for tonight. 
\\ 
\ 
\ {i11}
\\ 
\ 
\ \ ROSE. I'm sorry, Grandmother, but that is ridiculous. Do you not see how ridiculous this is? She lives because some idiot tripped over a tree- 
{c9} {d9} 
{c10} {d10} 
{c11} {d11} 
{c12} {d12} {i12}\ I do want to hear them Grandmother, I just want them to be better. 
\ {i13}\ GRANDMOTHER. Why don't I leave this here for you to look through. Maybe you'll find something that surprises you. 
\\ 
\ 
\ {i14}
\\ 
\ 
\ \ ROSE. \ {i15}\ I kinda doubt that. 
\ {i16}\ ROSE. Prince saves the day... King orders everyone killed...Prince saves another day... \ {i17}\ And so on and so on... 
\ {i18}\ ROSE. I wish... I just wish that there was a story where the girl, or princess, or whatever, didn't need to be saved. I wish that she could save herself for once.

{c27} {d27} 
{c28} {d28} {i58}\ doing? Did you just pinch yourself?

{c29} {d29} 
{c30} {d30} 
{c31} {d31} 
{c32} {d32} {i61}\ \ {i62}\ SPY. We both know you were. The real question is \ {i63}\ were you pinching yourself? 
\ {i64}\ ROSE. If you must know, I was trying to wake myself up. But it didn't work, so... that's it. 
\ {i65}\ SPY. Does it normally? 
{c33} {d33} 
{c34} {d34} 
{c35} {d35}

\ {i70}\ \ {i71}\ SPY. Haha, hey.. You don't really want to head that way do you? 
\\ 
\ 
\ {i72}
\\ 
\ 
\ \ ROSE. No, I was just walking this way for fun. 
{c44} {d44} 
{c45} {d45} 
{c46} {d46} {i73}\ N-nothing. Just a boring old cabin with a boring old lady doing boring old things. Totally not fun. If you want fun- 
\ {i74}\ ROSE. \ {i75}\ Oh and let me guess. This "boring" old woman is secretly a witch. 
\ {i76}\ SPY. You've heard of her then? 
{c47} {d47} {i77}\ \ {i78}\ ROSE. And I'll be forced to live that way for seven years until I convince a prince to kiss me, and then we'll live happily ever after in his castle. 
{c48} {d48} 
{c49} {d49} {i79}\ Oooooo. 
{c50} {d50} {i80}\ ROSE. RIGHT?! Why would anyone in their right mind kiss a frog just because it tells you to? 
\ {i81}\ SPY. Do you.. normally talk to frogs? 
{c51} {d51} 
{c52} {d52} {i82}\ Me neither. 
\ {i83}\ ROSE. But that's what happens in all the stories, so... 
{c53} {d53} 
{c54} {d54} 
{c55} {d55} {i84}
\\ 
\ 
\ \ ROSE. Whatever. You know what? It doesn't really matter what direction I head in anyway, so if it will make you happy, I'll head this way. 
\ {i85}\ SPY. Thank you... 
{c56} {d56} 
{c57} {d57} 
{c58} {d58} {i86}\ Whatever!

\ \ ROSE. You have got to be kidding me! 
{c59} {d59} {i89}\ right here.. in the middle of a path. That's a bit odd. 
{c60} {d60} 
{c61} {d61} 
{c62} {d62} 
{c63} {d63} {i90}\ You know them too? \ {i91}\ them. 
{c64} {d64} {i92}\ Wait, what do you mean, "\ {i93}\ ? What happened to them? Where are they? 
{c65} {d65} {i94}\ ROSE. I'm sure that's exactly what happened. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to find a way out of this place. 
\ {i95}\ \ {i96}\ \ {i97}\ ROSE. What do you want? Get off of me? \ {i98}\ Are these things with you?

\ {i101}\ \ {i102}\ SNOW. Still am actually. That must have been a \ {i103}\ nap. 
\ {i104}\ \ {i105}\ ROSE. What are you doing? That's a \ {i106}\ apple. You didn't fall asleep. That "sweet old lady" tried to kill you. 
{c66} {d66} {i107}\ ROSE. Do you normally just put things in your mouth that you find on the ground? 
{c67} {d67} 
{c68} {d68} {i108}\ weird for you... 
{c69} {d69} 
{c70} {d70} 
{c71} {d71} {i109}\ If you say so. 
{c72} {d72} 
{c73} {d73} {i110}\ You're right. 
\ {i111}\ ROSE. I give up! 
{c74} {d74} 
{c75} {d75} 
{c76} {d76} {i112}
\\ 
\ 
\ \ \ {i113}\ ROSE. Ok. You can come with me if you want, but I really am in a hurry. 
\ {i114}\ SNOW. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I promise I won't slow you down at all. 
{c77} {d77} {i115}\ \ {i116}\ SNOW. So... where are you headed anyway? 
{c78} {d78} {i117}\ SNOW. Why do you want to go there? 
{c79} {d79} {i118}\ You said you wouldn't slow me down. Now are you coming or not? 
{c80} {d80} {i119}\ ROSE. Yeah, I figure that is true. She's probably also behind your dwarfs going missing too. 
{c81} {d81} 
{c82} {d82} {i120}\ \ {i121}\ \ {i122}\ \ {i123}\ RED. I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
\ {i124}\ ROSE. Oh, and why is that? No, wait, let me guess. A big bad wolf lives in there and he is oh so very hungry. I appreciate the looking out, but I think we'll be fine. 
\ {i125}\ \ {i126}\ RED. I used to think that way too. You see that path over there? That's the very same path I would take twice a week to see my sweet old grandmother. My mother, she warned me not to leave the path. She told me there were dangerous things in these woods, but I thought she was just trying to scare me. But, oh, was I wrong. 
{c83} {d83} {i127}\ RED. Very much so. Just a few weeks ago, when I was on my way to visit Granny, I noticed that the flowers were finally starting to break from their wintry sleep, and I saw the most beautiful patch of wildflowers a little ways off the path. But despite all of the warnings from my mother, I decided that I should grab a few for my sweet Granny. I really didn't see what harm it could do. I mean, I could still see the path from the patch after all. But just as I bent over to grab the first flower to start my bouquet, a dark shadow fell over me. 
\ {i128}\ \ {i129}\ RED. Fearing the worst, I turned to see the largest wolf you would ever imagine licking his lips and grinning. I had to think quickly, so without 
giving it a second thought. I threw my basket at the beast and began running. I started to think I was going to make it, but a few steps from the path, I stumbled over something sticking out of the ground and went flying down on my knees. I turned just in time to see the wolf charging at me. I knew I was done for, yet just as I was about to give up any hope of seeing my grandmother ever again, I noticed what I had tripped over. 
\ {i130}\ RED. It had been left on the ground. As if someone had been cutting down a tree, and then suddenly realized they had somewhere else to be. Without even a moment of hesitation, I reached for it and swung it at the now lunging wolf, grazing him on his front leg, but not before he left me with this. 
\ {i131}\ \ {i132}\ ROSE. The wolf did that? 
\ {i133}\ SNOW. You know, maybe we would be better off- 
\ {i134}\ \ {i135}\ SNOW. What was that? 
{c84} {d84} {i136}\ ROSE. We need to help her. 
{c85} {d85} {i137}\ \ {i138}\ ROSE. Are you both serious? Whoever that is needs our help. 
{c86} {d86} {i139}\ RED. I have to look out for myself. 
{c87} {d87} {i140}\ Where would you be if you didn't just so happen to find that axe lying there? 
\ {i141}\ ROSE. \ {i142}\ And you, you'd still be lying down poisoned by that apple if I hadn't come along. Now you're both just going to sit here while someone else needs \ {i143}\ help? 
\ {i144}\ ROSE. You two are unbelievable.

{c99} {d99} {i180}\ \ {i181}\ WITCH. No. 
{c100} {d100}

{c189} {d189} 
{c190} {d190} {i279}\ Shut up, you! One more word and you'll be in my stew before you can even say "ribbit"\ {i280}\ How could you screw thi- \ {i281}\ Wait, what did you say? 
\ {i282}\ WITCH. You! Boy. What did you just say. 
\ {i283}\ WOLF. I think he is afraid that you're trying to trick him into talking so you can eat him for stew.\ {i284}\ WITCH. TALK. NOW. Who is this Rose? 
{c191} {d191} {i285}\ But she seemed to know all about you. And now she's coming to save me. 
{c192} {d192} 
{c193} {d193} {i286}\ WITCH. Lock him up, and get ready. Sounds like we're going to have company.

\ {i291}\ ROSE. Tell us what happened. 
\ {i292}\ MAIDEN. She kept me chained up for the last few days and has been feeding me some awful stew. I think she was trying to fatten me up so she could eat me.

{c198} {d198} {i293}\ MAIDEN. He always wore this funny little hat though.

{c206} {d206} {i296}\ SNOW. She might have my friends. I need to try. They'd do it for me.\ {i297}\ RAPUNZEL. If she really has done all of this stuff, someone needs to stop her.

{c208} {d208} {i300}\ \ {i301}\ ROSE. There he is, eh? 
{c209} {d209} {i302}\ ROSE. Wait.. Why me? 
{c210} {d210} 
{c211} {d211} {i303}\ your idea to come all this way after all. 
{c212} {d212} 
{c213} {d213} 
{c214} {d214} {i304}\ \ {i305}\ \ {i306}\ \ {i307}\ \ {i308}\ ROSE. No! 
{c215} {d215} 
{c216} {d216} {i309}\ \ {i310}\ RED. That's just wrong. 
{c217} {d217} 
{c218} {d218} {i311}\ SNOW. \ {i312}\ Have you happened to seen any dwarfs around here? About yay tall? 
\ {i313}\ SPY. Yeah. They are downstairs in the basement. 
{c219} {d219} 
{c220} {d220} {i314}\ \ {i315}\ RAPUNZEL. Did the witch really kidnap all of these people? 
\ {i316}\ RAPUNZEL. She was always so nice to me. I just didn't want to believe she could treat other people like this. 
{c221} {d221} {i317}\ \ {i318}\ WITCH. Look who it is. 
\ {i319}\ WITCH. The infamous Rose, I presume? And it looks like she brought along a friend to. 
\ {i320}\ \ {i321}\ \ {i322}\ WITCH. Rapunzel! What happened to your hair? How did you get out of the tower? 
{c222} {d222} {i323}\ WITCH. Of course not, my dear. You know I would never hurt anyone. 
{c223} {d223} 
{c224} {d224} 
{c225} {d225} 
{c226} {d226} {i324}\ RAPUNZEL. They won't do it again. I promise. Just let them all go with me, and we'll forget that it ever happened. 
{c227} {d227} 
{c228} {d228} 
{c229} {d229} {i325}\ RAPUNZEL. Let me go! 
\ {i326}\ RED. You heard the lady. Let. Her. Go. 
\ {i327}\ \ {i328}\ \ {i329}\ SPY. Rapunzel, Rose, follow us. Snow's dwarf friends got hold of some tools and they broke through the back. 
\ {i330}\ QUEEN. My dear nephew, no one is going anywhere. 
\ {i331}\ QUEEN. \ {i332}\ Where is she? 
{c230} {d230} 
{c231} {d231} {i333}\ one after. 
{c232} {d232} {i334}\ ROSE. You're never going to be the fairest. 
\ {i335}\ QUEEN. Excuse me? 
{c233} {d233} 
{c234} {d234} 
{c235} {d235} {i336}\ QUEEN. I am the Queen. I will be whatever I want to be. 
{c236} {d236} {i337}\ ROSE. You spend every waking moment of your day trying to knock the rest of us down to your level, just so you don't have to feel so worthless. 
{c237} {d237} {i338}\ ROSE. You treat us like your competition. We're not. If what you truly wanted was to be the best, you'd let our strengths become yours, instead of breaking us all down. 
\ {i339}\ WITCH. Will you shut her up already? Give me a few moments, my Queen, and I'll have them all back in their cages. 
\ {i340}\ ROSE. Do you know what makes Snow so special? Have you seen the way 
she goes about the world? Trusting all those around her? Helping anyone she comes across in need? You'll never have that unless you realize that true power comes from helping those around you. 
{c238} {d238} {i341}\ What do you have in mind. 
{c239} {d239} {i342}\ ROSE. You could start by letting me and my friends go. 
{c240} {d240} 
{c241} {d241} {i343}\ QUEEN. And what about her? 
\ {i344}\ SPY. Aunty Queen, if I may. 
\ {i345}\ WITCH. Why you little good for- ACHOO! 
\ {i346}\ WITCH. Baaaa. Baaaaa. 
\ {i347}\ SPY. \ {i348}\ I'd run if I were you. 
\ {i349}\ \ {i350}\ QUEEN. What was that about empowering those around me instead of getting rid of them? 
{c242} {d242} {i351}\ QUEEN. You know, if you're any good with that, I could use a new Head of the Royal Guard? 
\ {i352}\ QUEEN. Come. I'm sure we can find something for each of you. On a trial basis of course. See how this whole benevolent thing works out. 
\ {i353}\ SPY. Thank you for saving me. 
{c243} {d243} 
{c244} {d244} 
{c245} {d245} {i354}\ What needs- No?

{c249} {d249} 
{c250} {d250} {i362}\ ROSE. Did you pinch me?

{c258} {d258} {i368}\ Huh? Find one what? 
{c259} {d259} {i369}\ A story that met your standards? 
\ {i370}\ ROSE. Yeah. I suppose I did.
