{c1} "As he thus spoke, the good dwarfs felt pity for him and gave him the coffin. The prince had his servants carry it away on their shoulders. But-" <br>
{c2} Wait, wait, wait... They just {i2} Snow White's dead body to a random dude in the woods? <br>
{c3} Not a random "dude". To the prince. "But then it happened-" <br>
{c4} No, not " {i3} " prince, " {i4} " prince. And the dwarfs didn't even know if he was the real deal. They just took his word and {i5} him their friend's body. <br>{i6}
{c5} What?! <br>
{c6} Do you want to hear how it ends or not? <br>
{c7} Fine. But if this turns into another one of those "creepy stranger kisses passed out girl and saves her life" stories, I'm throwing that book in the fire and sleeping warmly tonight. <br>
{c8} No, no. It's nothing like that. <br>
{c9} It better not be. <br>{i7-8}</u></b><br><br></i>

{c11} ARE YOU KIDDING ME? <br></i></u></b><br><br>{i10}</u></b><br><br></i>
{c12} All right. That's enough for tonight. <br></i></u></b><br><br>{i11}</u></b><br><br></i>
{c13} I'm sorry, Grandmother, but that is ridiculous. Do you not see how ridiculous this is? She lives because some idiot tripped over a tree- <br>
{c14} "Stumbled on some brush." <br>
{c15} How is that any better?! Do you really not see anything wrong with this? Every single one of these stories! If they aren't selling the daughter, or locking her away, they're nearly killing her off and having some blundering fool save the day. Half the time not even on purpose. They just, in this case literally, stumble over the way to save the day. <br>
{c16} You're the one who keeps asking me to read these to you. I don't know why you do that if you don't want to hear them. <br>
{c17} {i12} I do want to hear them Grandmother, I just want them to be better. <br>{i13}
{c18} Why don't I leave this here for you to look through. Maybe you'll find something that surprises you. <br></i></u></b><br><br>{i14}</u></b><br><br></i>
{c19} {i15} I kinda doubt that. <br>{i16}
{c20} Prince saves the day... King orders everyone killed...Prince saves another day... {i17} And so on and so on... <br>{i18}
{c21} I wish... I just wish that there was a story where the girl, or princess, or whatever, didn't need to be saved. I wish that she could save herself for once. <br>{i19}<br></i></u></b><br><br><b>

{c23} Well, that can't be good. <br>{i24-30}
{c24} Where in fairy's name were you? <br>
{c25} I am so very sorry. I was cleaning out the cages in the basement when I he- <br>
{c26} Does it look like I care? <br>
{c27} I... I don't kn- <br>
{c28} That was rhetorical! Of course I don't care where you were, or what you were doing. When I ring, you come, understand? <br></i></u></b><br><br>{i31}</u></b><br><br></i>
{c29} Is that rhetorical too? <br>{i32-34}
{c30} Down, Wolf. <br>
{c31} But you said I could have all the sheep I wanted. <br>{i35-36}
{c32} I know what I said, but we need him at the moment. <br>{i37-38}
{c33} You see what happens when you make me mad? Are you happy now? <br>
{c34} I can't quite say "happy" is what I am feeling at the moment. <br>
{c35} Good. You know why? Because literally not a single person within a hundred miles cares if you are happy. The only reason you are not in one of those cages with the rest of the men of the kingdom is because you are the Queen's only nephew. I was asked to spare you, but never once did "happy" enter the conversation. <br>
{c36} I understand. <br>
{c37} Better. Now I need you to run an errand for me. <br>
{c38} Anything! <br>
{c39} I appear to need a few ingredients. I could use some rosemary... <br>{i39}
{c40} I'm also getting low on thyme... lavender... Ooh, and might as well have you grab some hemlock while you're at it. <br>{i40}
{c41} Off you go. <br>{i41-42}
{c42} I've got a little errand for you too, Wolf. <br>{i43}
{c43} Does it involve dinner. <br>
{c44} It sure does. Remember that brat I poisoned in the woods the other day? Take care of the body. I want no evidence I was ever there. <br>

{c46} Well, this is unexpected. <br>{i47-54}
{c47} Ow! <br>{i55-57}
ROSE/SPY. Ahh! <br>
{c48} What are you doing?! <br>
{c49} I'm walking through the meadow. What are {i58} doing? Did you just pinch yourself? <br>{i59-60}
{c50} It's none of your business what I am doing. <br>
{c51} You were pinching yourself. <br>
{c52} No, I wasn't. <br>
{c53} You very clearly were. <br>
{c54} Leave me alone. <br>{i61-62}
{c55} We both know you were. The real question is {i63} were you pinching yourself? <br>{i64}
{c56} If you must know, I was trying to wake myself up. But it didn't work, so... that's it. <br>{i65}
{c57} Does it normally? <br>
{c58} What? <br>
{c59} Does pinching yourself normally wake you up? I mean it seems like a pretty ineffici- <br>
{c60} I don't know. It's just what you do. You know? <br>
{c61} It is not what {i66} do. <br>
{c62} Not "you" as in {i67} , just as in the stories. <br>
{c63} Not in any stories that I am familiar with, but anyway, you're wrong. <br>
{c64} I'm wrong? <br>
{c65} You're wrong. <br>
{c66} About what? <br>
{c67} You said it didn't work, yet here you are. Walking, talking... pinching, and very much awake. <br>
{c68} I'm not- <br>{i68}
{c69} You know what? It was very nice to meet you Mister... <br>{i69}
{c70} Okay. Good day. <br>{i70-71}
{c71} Haha, hey.. You don't really want to head that way do you? <br></i></u></b><br><br>{i72}</u></b><br><br></i>
{c72} No, I was just walking this way for fun. <br>
{c73} Uhh... I am not so sure that "fun" is what you would find that way. <br>
{c74} Oh? And what would I find that way? <br>
{c75} {i73} N-nothing. Just a boring old cabin with a boring old lady doing boring old things. Totally not fun. If you want fun- <br>{i74}
{c76} {i75} Oh and let me guess. This "boring" old woman is secretly a witch. <br>{i76}
{c77} You've heard of her then? <br>
{c78} And if I knock on her door, she'll invite me inside and turn me into a frog. <br>{i77-78}
{c79} And I'll be forced to live that way for seven years until I convince a prince to kiss me, and then we'll live happily ever after in his castle. <br>
{c80} Prin.. What? No. Where she'll throw you in a pot and eat you. <br>
{c81} {i79} Oooooo. <br>
{c82} Why would a Prince ever kiss a frog? That is perhaps the most absurd thing I've ever- <br>{i80}
{c83} RIGHT?! Why would anyone in their right mind kiss a frog just because it tells you to? <br>{i81}
{c84} Do you.. normally talk to frogs? <br>
{c85} NO! <br>
{c86} Okay. Good. {i82} Me neither. <br>{i83}
{c87} But that's what happens in all the stories, so... <br>
{c88} I hope I don't offend, but I think you really need to start reading some better stories. <br>
{c89} Tell me about it. <br>
{c90} That aside, I still wouldn't head that way. She's been in a bit of a mood <br>
recently. <br></i></u></b><br><br>{i84}</u></b><br><br></i>
{c91} Whatever. You know what? It doesn't really matter what direction I head in anyway, so if it will make you happy, I'll head this way. <br>{i85}

{c96} You have got to be kidding me! <br>
{c97} Oh, I am sorry. I must have taken a little nap. {i89} right here.. in the middle of a path. That's a bit odd. <br>
{c98} Snow White, I presume? <br>
{c99} No need to be so formal. You can call me Snow. That's what all my friends call me. <br>
{c100} You mean the dwarfs? <br>
{c101} {i90} You know them too? {i91} them. <br>
{c102} I'm familiar. {i92} Wait, what do you mean, " {i93} ? What happened to them? Where are they? <br>
{c103} Well that's just it, I don't know. I was out looking for them when.. I don't know. I must have gotten tired and laid down. <br>{i94}
{c104} I'm sure that's exactly what happened. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to find a way out of this place. <br>{i95-97}
{c105} What do you want? Get off of me? {i98} Are these things with you? <br></i></u></b><br><br>{i99}</u></b><br><br></i>
{c106} {i100} I think there was a sweet old lady giving out apples. I was quite hungry and then... <br>{i101-102}
{c107} Still am actually. That must have been a {i103} nap. <br>{i104-105}
{c108} What are you doing? That's a {i106} apple. You didn't fall asleep. That "sweet old lady" tried to kill you. <br>
{c109} Oh. OH! <br>{i107}
{c110} Do you normally just put things in your mouth that you find on the ground? <br>
{c111} Yes? Where else would I get it from? <br>
{c112} I don't know the store? Oh, right. I guess that's not {i108} weird for you... <br>
{c113} What's a store? <br>
{c114} It's nothing. Nevermind. Still, you need to be more careful who you trust. <br>
{c115} {i109} If you say so. <br>
{c116} No, not if I say so. You need to think through things. You don't know me at all. Why would you just take my advice? <br>
{c117} {i110} You're right. <br>{i111}
{c118} I give up! <br>
{c119} No wait! Please don't leave. <br>
{c120} I don't have time for this! <br>
{c121} Please! <br></i></u></b><br><br>{i112-113}
{c122} Ok. You can come with me if you want, but I really am in a hurry. <br>{i114}
{c123} Thank you, thank you, thank you! I promise I won't slow you down at all. <br>
{c124} You better not. <br>{i115-116}
{c125} So... where are you headed anyway? <br>
{c126} To the Witch's House through those woods. <br>{i117}
{c127} Why do you want to go there? <br>
{c128} {i118} You said you wouldn't slow me down. Now are you coming or not? <br>
{c129} It's just... I think that might have been who poisoned me? <br>{i119}
{c130} Yeah, I figure that is true. She's probably also behind your dwarfs going missing too. <br>
{c131} You think? <br>
{c132} Only one way to find out. <br>{i120-123}
{c133} I wouldn't go in there if I were you. <br>{i124}
{c134} Oh, and why is that? No, wait, let me guess. A big bad wolf lives in there and he is oh so very hungry. I appreciate the looking out, but I think we'll be fine. <br>{i125-126}
{c135} I used to think that way too. You see that path over there? That's the very same path I would take twice a week to see my sweet old grandmother. My mother, she warned me not to leave the path. She told me there were dangerous things in these woods, but I thought she was just trying to scare me. But, oh, was I wrong. <br>
{c136} You were? <br>{i127}
{c137} Very much so. Just a few weeks ago, when I was on my way to visit Granny, I noticed that the flowers were finally starting to break from their wintry sleep, and I saw the most beautiful patch of wildflowers a little ways off the path. But despite all of the warnings from my mother, I decided that I should grab a few for my sweet Granny. I really didn't see what harm it could do. I mean, I could still see the path from the patch after all. But just as I bent over to grab the first flower to start my bouquet, a dark shadow fell over me. <br>{i128-129}
{c138} Fearing the worst, I turned to see the largest wolf you would ever imagine licking his lips and grinning. I had to think quickly, so without <br>
giving it a second thought. I threw my basket at the beast and began running. I started to think I was going to make it, but a few steps from the path, I stumbled over something sticking out of the ground and went flying down on my knees. I turned just in time to see the wolf charging at me. I knew I was done for, yet just as I was about to give up any hope of seeing my grandmother ever again, I noticed what I had tripped over. <br>{i130}
{c139} It had been left on the ground. As if someone had been cutting down a tree, and then suddenly realized they had somewhere else to be. Without even a moment of hesitation, I reached for it and swung it at the now lunging wolf, grazing him on his front leg, but not before he left me with this. <br>{i131-132}
{c140} The wolf did that? <br>{i133}
{c141} You know, maybe we would be better off- <br>{i134-135}
{c142} What was that? <br>
{c143} Looks like the wolf found his next victim. <br>{i136}
{c144} We need to help her. <br>
{c145} Have fun. <br>{i137-138}
{c146} Are you both serious? Whoever that is needs our help. <br>
{c147} I'm sorry. I'm not the heroic type. <br>{i139}
{c148} I have to look out for myself. <br>
{c149} {i140} Where would you be if you didn't just so happen to find that axe lying there? <br>{i141}
{c150} {i142} And you, you'd still be lying down poisoned by that apple if I hadn't come along. Now you're both just going to sit here while someone else needs {i143} help? <br>{i144}

{c153} HALT! Thou foul witch! Repent for your misdeeds immediately, and I may just have mercy on your wicked soul! <br>{i151-152}
{c154} Oh! My dear Prince Charming, you're right. You're so right! I've led such a wicked life, and I don't deserve your mercy. <br>{i153-154}
{c155} Well... if I say you should have it, then... well... then you should have it. <br>
{c156} As you wish my liege! <br>{i155}
{c157} Oooohh! <br>{i156-157}
{c158} Are you okay? <br>
{c159} Oh.. Oh yes. I'll be fine. I just needed you to come a little closer. <br>{i158-160}
{c160} Baaaaaaaaaaa. <br>{i161-162}
{c161} Um, I'm so very sor- <br>{i163}

{c163} I k-k-kn-nnow Your Wickedness, bu-b-bbut- <br>

{c166} And what did I say was going to happen? <br>
{c167} You s-s-sss-aid you were go-g-g-gon-nna turn me into a f-f-rf-fr- <br>
{c168} A what? <br>
{c169} A f-fr-frog. <br>{i165}
{c170} {i166} said that? I would never do something like that to you. <br>{i167}
{c171} No? <br>
{c172} Not at all. Frogs are for stew. You wouldn't taste very well I'd imagine. I think something from the rodent family would be much more fitting for you. <br>{i168-169}
{c173} Oh do leave the poor little guy alone. Unfortunately he was cursed with his father's spine. Regardless, it's not like he had very much choice in the matter. {i170} sent him in. <br>{i171}
{c174} {i172} Leave. Now. <br>{i173-176}

{c177} No. No. Not at all. Just preparing dinner. <br>{i179}
{c178} Nevermind that. What are you doing here? I thought we decided that it was best not to be seen with each other. What would the Kingdom say if- <br>
{c179} Do you dare lecture me on my Kingdom? I don't tell you how much Newt's Tail to put in your.. recipes, do I? <br>{i180-181}
{c180} No. <br>
{c181} Then why don't we each stick to what we know best, shall we? <br>
{c182} Very well. What can I help you with, Your Majesty. <br>
{c183} That's more like it. I'm {i182} because I think there is something wrong with that looking glass you gave me. <br>
{c184} Impossible. <br>
{c185} You keep saying that. Yet, when I checked on it this afternoon, it still seems to think Snow White is the fairest in the land. <br>
{c186} Snow White? <br>
{c187} Yes. You know, the one you promised me just last night that had been taken out of the picture... permanently? <br>
{c188} Oh, {i183} Snow White. <br>
{c189} Yes! {i184} Snow White. And what's worse, when I continued to ask the glass who was the most clever in the land, someone new popped up. <br>
{c190} Oh? <br>
{c191} Oh. What do you know of this new "Rose" girl parading through the woods like she owns the place? <br>
{c192} She's nothing. You don't need to worry about her even a little. She'll be taken care of, trust me. <br>
{c193} That's just the thing. I don't trust you. I didn't before any of this, and I surely don't now. You're a necessity and nothing more. But if you can't even do this one little thing for me, then I am not so sure you're even that. <br>
{c194} But Your Ma- <br>
{c195} But NOTHING! {i185} Or do you need a reminder of just what I am capable of. {i186} Just a few words and I could have you begging for me to spare you. <br>{i187}
{c196} That won't be necessary. Please Your Majesty. I'll do whatever you ask. <br>{i188}
{c197} You have until the end of the day to bring me both Snow White and this new Rose, or I'll be the one feeding {i189} to the rodents. <br>{i190}

{c200} I think it came from over here. <br>{i197-201}
{c201} Snow, what did we just say about picking food off the ground and eating it? <br>
{c202} Bread. <br>
{c203} Excuse me? <br>
{c204} I thought it looked a little out of place. It's bread! <br>
{c205} And what if you were wrong? It could have been a poisonous mushroom or something! <br>{i202-203}
{c206} It's a trail. <br>
{c207} What? <br>
{c208} Look, it's a trail of breadcrumbs! <br>
{c209} Why would there be a trail of breadcrumbs in the middle of the forest? <br>{i204}
{c210} Snow, where did the trail start? <br>{i205}
{c211} Well this way they trail off back towards the meadow... but if we follow it this way we... <br>
{c212} What are you doing? <br>{i206}
{c213} Hansel? <br>{i207}
{c214} Gretel? <br>{i208}
{c215} How did you know I was here? Do I know you? How do you know Hansel? Have you seen him? <br>
{c216} Woah, woah.. calm down. We heard a scream and came looking for you. <br>
{c217} Oh, yeah. That was me. I thought I saw something back there, which made me scream, and then I was afraid that my scream would draw it closer, so I hid, and then I heard you coming and thought maybe you were <br>
her, so I- <br>
{c218} "Her" who? <br>{i209}
{c219} The witch. <br>
{c220} Oh... <br>
{c221} You've seen her? <br>{i210}
{c222} Do you know where she is? <br>{i211}
{c223} Gretel, I'm Rose. This here is Snow. And this is- <br>
{c224} You can call me Red. <br>
{c225} Red. Yes. We're actually looking to find the witch. We think she may have something to do with Snow's missing friends. <br>
{c226} Her basement is full of people. <br>
{c227} You were in the witch's basement and made it out? <br>{i212}
{c228} Did you see a group of dwarfs? They were probably whistling a whole lot? <br>
{c229} I really wasn't down there long. My brother Hansel and I stumbled across her house when we were trying to find our way home.I saw that there were a bunch of people locked up downstairs, and I knew we needed to get out of there as fast as we could, but then she found us. We turned to run, and I didn't stop running until I could no longer breathe. I thought we had made it until I looked around and noticed that I was alone. Hansel must have been caught by her, and I didn't even notice. <br>
{c230} Why didn't you go back in for him? <br>
{c231} I wanted to! But by the time I noticed, I was lost! I've been trying to find my way back ever since. <br>
{c232} How long ago was that? <br>
{c233} Three days ago. <br>
{c234} And you've been out here for that long, lost, by yourself? <br>{i213}
{c235} I just found Hansel's breadcrumb trail this morning, and I started following it. I figured either way it would lead me back to him, or home where I could find help. <br>{i214} RED. What was that? <br>{i215}
{c236} Hello? Is anyone out there? <br>
{c237} {i216} It's her! <br>{i217}
{c238} Whoever is out there, show yourself. We might be able to help you? <br>{i218}
{c239} Oh, I have no doubt that you can help me. <br>
{c240} We don't want any trouble. <br>
{c241} Well that's unfortunate, because trouble is exactly what you're about to get. <br>
{c242} What do you want. <br>
{c243} So many things. Originally, I only came for a little snack. I heard that there was a nice tasty treat asleep in the meadow. imagine my disappointment to only find a half eaten apple instead. But now... <br>{i219}
{c244} {i220} How pleased she's going to be with me now that I've found her little escapee. {i221} I'm sure she'll be thrilled to have you right along with her. <br>{i222}
{c245} But you... you I am going to keep for myself. I think a little payback might be in order. <br>{i223}
{c246} Has anyone ever told you what big eyes you have? <br>
{c247} Ah, the better to see you with. <br>
{c248} See, I would think it makes for a bigger target. <br>{i224-226}
{c249} RUN! <br>{i227}{i228}
{c250} Here. Let's hide in here. <br>
{c251} {i229} I don't see any door, do any of you? <br>
{c252} No. I don't. <br>
{c253} Look, there is a window up there. It's too high though. <br>
{c254} Maybe we can climb a tree and cross over on a branch? <br>
{c255} Too far. They don't reach. <br>
{c256} Maybe if I can get enough of my helpers, they can take us one by one? <br>{i230-231}
{c257} If a single one of your pigeons lays a feather on me, I'll be eating stew for a week. <br>{i232-234}
{c258} Get behind me. I've got this. <br>{i235}
{c259} Shh. Do you hear that? <br>{i236}
{c260} Is that someone humming? <br>
{c261} I can't hear anything over the noise of those flying rodents. <br>{i237}
{c262} I think I know what this is. <br>{i238-239}
{c263} Hello? Is anyone up there? <br>{i240}
{c264} Oh! Hello down there! <br>
{c265} Hello! Is ther- <br>
{c266} How are you all doing on this beautiful day? <br>
{c267} Good. But we're in a bit of trouble down here. Is there an- <br>
{c268} Wow. I love your hair. I've always wanted to grow mine long. <br>
{c269} {i241} Not now. {i242} Would it at all be poss- <br>{i243}
{c270} It's coming! <br>
{c271} Oh for fairy's sake. Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair! <br>{i244-249}
{c272} If I may ask, what was that all about? <br>
{c273} Evil Witch sent a murderous wolf to eat us. <br>
{c274} I see. I see. {i250} Why would she do that? <br>
{c275} Because she's a witch. <br>
{c276} Right. Gotcha. {i251} And is that something witches do? <br>
{c277} Yeah. Most witches are pretty big on the whole torture and killing thing. It's sorta what they're known for. <br>
{c278} Well, not {i252} witches, right? I know a witch, and she's my best friend. <br>
{c279} I guess I don't know about all of them. I've only met one, but she's tried to kill me quite a few times. <br>
{c280} One tried to eat me and my brother. <br>{i253}
{c281} I'm sorry. I kind of think in this area, there is only one witch, and she's... well she's not the nicest person it seems. <br></i></u></b><br><br>{i254}</u></b><br><br></i>
{c282} I think we should head back down now. The Wolf seems to have kept moving. <br>
{c283} That can't be true. <br>
{c284} It is. I think it- <br>
{c285} Not the wolf. The witch. The witch I know would never try to kill anyone. She is nice to everyone. <br>
{c286} Have you seen her around anyone else? <br>
{c287} Well n- <br>
{c288} Rapunzel, have you ever asked why you're locked up here? All by yourself? <br>
{c289} To keep me safe. <br>
{c290} Safe from what? <br>
{c291} I don't... know. <br>
{c292} I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but your friend, the witch? She stole you from your parents when you were a kid, and hid you up here to punish them. <br>
{c293} No. That can't be. She wouldn't do that. <br>
{c294} If we want to get out of the forest before it gets dark, we need to leave. <br>
{c295} How will we get back down. <br>
{c296} The same way we came up. <br>
{c297} {i255} If you don't believe me, come with us. We're on our way to see your friend right now. Ask her for yourself. <br>
{c298} I don't know if that's such a good idea. <br>
{c299} Suit yourself! <br>
{c300} Trust us. We'll show you. <br>{i256}
{c301} Okay. If only to show you all how wrong you are. <br>
{c302} Okay, now that she is coming too, how will she get down. <br>
{c303} Well we can tie one part of her hair here... <br>{i257}
{c304} And she can- <br>{i258-260}
{c305} There we go. Escape rope. <br>{i261}
{c306} It really was beautiful hair. <br>{i262-263}
{c307} It'll be okay. It'll grow back, I promise. <br></i></u></b><br><br>{i264}</u></b><br><br></i><b>

{c310} What do you think you are doing?! <br>{i270}
{c311} Go! Run! <br>{i271-272}
{c312} You just cost me my dinner. I don't care who you are related to, that is going to cost you dearly. <br>{i273}
{c313} They got away. {i274}
{c314} {i275} got away? <br>
{c315} Those girls you sent me after. {i276}
{c316} Those girls? You mean the one girl, who was all but dead on the side of a road. {i277} got away? <br>{i278}
{c317} Yes. She was with three others. That little brat who escaped the other day, the one who chopped at me with an axe a few weeks ago, and some new girl, wearing very odd clothes. <br>
{c318} Rose? <br>
{c319} {i279} Shut up, you! One more word and you'll be in my stew before you can even say "ribbit" {i280} How could you screw thi- {i281} Wait, what did you say? <br>{i282}
{c320} You! Boy. What did you just say. <br>{i283}
{c321} I think he is afraid that you're trying to trick him into talking so you can eat him for stew. {i284}
{c322} TALK. NOW. Who is this Rose? <br>
{c323} No idea. {i285} But she seemed to know all about you. And now she's coming to save me. <br>
{c324} And why in fairy's name would she do that? <br>
{c325} Because she wants me to be happy. She said it herself. {i286}

{c328} The witch! <br>{i290}
{c329} It's okay. You're okay. We're here to help. <br>{i291}
{c330} Tell us what happened. <br>{i292}
{c331} She kept me chained up for the last few days and has been feeding me some awful stew. I think she was trying to fatten me up so she could eat me. <br>
{c332} Did you see anyone else there? <br>
{c333} Yes, but only one. He freed me. <br>
{c334} What did he look like? <br>
{c335} Was he a dwarf? <br>{i293}
{c336} He always wore this funny little hat though. <br>{i294}
{c337} I think I know who you are talking about. <br>
{c338} You have to help him! He set me free, but just as we were leaving, the witch returned, and he stayed behind to save me. <br>
{c339} Of course he did. <br>
{c340} Will you help him? Before she turns him into a frog? <br>
{c341} Can you show us the way, and how to get in? <br>
{c342} I think so. <br>
{c343} {i295} Last chance. Any of you want to head back, now is the time. <br>
{c344} Mine as well. We're almost there already. <br>
{c345} Do you know how to get to the basement. {i296}
{c346} She might have my friends. I need to try. They'd do it for me. {i297}

{c351} Yes. Can you save him? <br>{i302}
{c352} Wait.. Why me? <br>
{c353} You're the one who led us here. <br>
{c354} It {i303} your idea to come all this way after all. <br>
{c355} I'm here for my brother. <br>
{c356} Please? I'll be right behind you. <br>
{c357} Okay! Okay! I'll do it. Just... give me a second. <br>{i304-308}
{c358} No! <br>
{c359} What is it with you and kissing frogs? That is so gross! <br>
{c360} And you yell at me for eating an apple I found by a tree. This somehow seems much worse. <br>{i309-310}
{c361} That's just wrong. <br>
{c362} I really should have stayed in my tower. <br>
{c363} Okay, can we all just pretend that didn't happen, for like one second? <br>{i311}
{c364} {i312} Have you happened to seen any dwarfs around here? About yay tall? <br>{i313}
{c365} Yeah. They are downstairs in the basement. <br>
{c366} What about my brother? <br>
{c367} He should be down there too. Here, I'll show you. <br>{i314-315}
{c368} Did the witch really kidnap all of these people? <br>{i316}
{c369} She was always so nice to me. I just didn't want to believe she could treat other people like this. <br>
{c370} I'm sorry. Sometimes bad people can be good to some, but it doesn't make them any less bad. <br>{i317-318}
{c371} Look who it is. <br>{i319}
{c372} The infamous Rose, I presume? And it looks like she brought along a friend to. <br>{i320-322}
{c373} Rapunzel! What happened to your hair? How did you get out of the tower? <br>
{c374} Did you... did you really do all these mean things they are saying you did? <br>{i323}
{c375} Of course not, my dear. You know I would never hurt anyone. <br>
{c376} Then you'll let me and my friends go? <br>
{c377} I'm sorry, I can't do that. <br>
{c378} But why not? <br>
{c379} Well your friends broke into my home. That's not a nice thing to do, is it? I can't just let them go away without being punished. How ever would they learn their lesson? <br>{i324}
{c380} They won't do it again. I promise. Just let them all go with me, and we'll forget that it ever happened. <br>
{c381} But see, that's where you're mistaken. <br>
{c382} I am? <br>
{c383} I have no intention of letting you go either. <br>{i325}
{c384} Let me go! <br>{i326}
{c385} You heard the lady. Let. Her. Go. <br>{i327-329}
{c386} Rapunzel, Rose, follow us. Snow's dwarf friends got hold of some tools and they broke through the back. <br>{i330}
{c387} My dear nephew, no one is going anywhere. <br>{i331}
{c388} {i332} Where is she? <br>
{c389} Which one? <br>
{c390} Snow. I'll deal with {i333} one after. <br>
{c391} If your nephew is to be believed, she is apparently tunneling a hole in my basement as we speak. <br>{i334}
{c392} You're never going to be the fairest. <br>{i335}
{c393} Excuse me? <br>
{c394} That's what you want, right? Well, you're never going to be that. <br>
{c395} Is that so? <br>
{c396} It is. You'll never be the fairest, or the most clever, or the most loved. <br>{i336}
{c397} I am the Queen. I will be whatever I want to be. <br>
{c398} Not this. Isn't that what your mirror keeps telling you? <br>{i337}
{c399} You spend every waking moment of your day trying to knock the rest of us down to your level, just so you don't have to feel so worthless. <br>
{c400} Who are you calling worthless?! <br>{i338}
{c401} You treat us like your competition. We're not. If what you truly wanted was to be the best, you'd let our strengths become yours, instead of breaking us all down. <br>{i339}
{c402} Will you shut her up already? Give me a few moments, my Queen, and I'll have them all back in their cages. <br>{i340}
{c403} Do you know what makes Snow so special? Have you seen the way <br>
she goes about the world? Trusting all those around her? Helping anyone she comes across in need? You'll never have that unless you realize that true power comes from helping those around you. <br>
{c404} {i341} What do you have in mind. <br>
{c405} You can't possibly be- <br>{i342}
{c406} You could start by letting me and my friends go. <br>
{c407} That's it? <br>
{c408} Well it's a start. Then you could use your position to start empowering those around you instead of trying to get rid of them. <br>{i343}
{c409} And what about her? <br>{i344}
{c410} Aunty Queen, if I may. <br>{i345}
{c411} Why you little good for- ACHOO! <br>{i346}
{c412} Baaaa. Baaaaa. <br>{i347}
{c413} {i348} I'd run if I were you. <br>{i349-350}
{c414} What was that about empowering those around me instead of getting rid of them? <br>
{c415} You need to start with those who have your best interest in mind. <br>{i351}
{c416} You know, if you're any good with that, I could use a new Head of the Royal Guard? <br>{i352}
{c417} Come. I'm sure we can find something for each of you. On a trial basis of course. See how this whole benevolent thing works out. <br>{i353}
{c418} Thank you for saving me. <br>
