PAXTON, a man in his late forties, dressed in a suit and tie. He walks up to a bulletin board and staples a sheet of paper with names written on it to the board. A small crowd surrounds him and tries to look at it. There is a commotion as he steps aside. Boys and Girls alike turn to their friends with various whispers of shock or excitement. After a few moments the crowd begins to dissipate, until only one student is left: CARLY REYNOLDS, a sophomore who is clearly distraught over the news on the paper. She stands there alone for a few moments. CARLY looks over at MR. PAXTON who is still shoving a few items into his briefcase. CARLY hesitantly walks over to him.]\n{sdes2} - [LIGHTS UP ON MS. ALEXANDRIA, a librarian, who is sitting behind a desk, organizing papers, and stamping them. After a moment, CARLY enters.)]\n{sdes3} - [MS. ALEXANDRIA brings CARLY to a new part of the library. The area appears hidden and covered in dust. There is a table with a couple of chairs and a single bookcase with hundreds of books on the shelves. MS. ALEXANDRIA blows the dust off a shelf and begins to search for a book.)]\n{sdes4} - [LIGHTS UP on CARLY in her room sitting on her bed with Rosalind's book in her hand. She takes her time getting comfortable and then opens the book. A few moments pass, and then ROSALIND FRANKLIN enters and sits down quietly in CARLY's computer chair. CARLY doesn't notice ROSALIND at first, and continues reading. When she finally looks up, CARLY jumps in shock.]\n{sdes5} - [LIGHTS UP on a group of boys sitting around a table huddled over a computer. MR. PAXTON is standing alongside them. After a few moments, CARLY enters and walks over to them. MR. PAXTON notices her and flinches in surprise.]\n{sdes6} - [LIGHTS UP on an empty library. CARLY enters and looks around for anyone. After a moment, MS. ALEXANDRIA enters, yelling off stage.]\n{sdes7} - [LIGHTS UP on CARLY, and two women, BARBARA MCCLINTOCK and ROSALYN YALOW, in the library. A few books lie open on desks.]\n{sdes8} - [LIGHTS UP on HEDY LAMARR, ROSALIND FRANKLIN, BARBARA MCCLINTOCK, and ROSALYN YALOW. They are all sitting and standing around a couple of tables in the library, impatiently waiting.]\n{sdes9} - [LIGHTS UP on MR. PAXTON at his desk. He is looking at his computer as CARLY walks in. He looks at her, and then gestures to an open seat in the classroom. CARLY takes her seat and puts her backpack on her table. She sits quietly staring straight ahead. MR. PAXTON shoots a few glances her way, but neither say a word. After a long while of nothing being said, MS. ALEXANDRIA pokes her head in the room.]\n{sdes10} - [LIGHTS UP on an empty library. There is a package on one of the tables. CARLY enters with her arms full of books. She begins shelving them into their spots on the bookshelf. After a few moments, she notices the package and investigates it. She looks around to see whom it may be from, but sees no one.]\n\nCharacter\n{c1} - [CARLY.]\n{c2} - [MR.

What can I do for you this afternoon?]\n{d3.1} - [To be honest, I'm a little confused.]\n{d4.1} - [Oh? Confused about what?]\n{d5.1} - [Well, I don't mean to be rude, but about the new S.T.E.M. team announcements. I know you give priority to Seniors and Juniors, but I am a little surprised by your two Sophomore picks.]\n{d6.1} - [Mr. Landry and Mr. Pruitt? Well, I would think it shouldn't come as that much of a shock. They are two of the top students in your class after all, are they not?]\n{d7.1} - [Of course! I am not trying to say they aren't qualified, but as you just said, they are only two of the top students. But neither are actually <em>the</em> top. Mike is barely in the top five. Especially in computer science. Which is the theme of this year's-]\n{d8.1} - [Ah, I see. But you are.]\n{d9.1} - [... Well, yeah.]\n{d10.1} - [They also have received outstanding accolades from Mr.]\n{d10.2} - [Reyes for their group midterm project, and teamwork is another major component for the team.]\n{d11.1} - [But I was also in that group! Shouldn't that count for something?]\n{d12.1} - [Of course it should. And don't think for a second that your name was not on the short list, because it was. However, sometimes more than just who did better on which assignment factors into these kind of decisions.]\n{d13.1} - [I know that. But then what does factor in.]\n{d14.1} - [Excuse me?]\n{d15.1} - [I'm curious about what can I do to improve my chances in the future.]\n{d16.1} - [Oh, Miss Reynolds. Nothing! You are a fantastic student and have done everything right. I am sure you'll make the team next year!]\n{d16.2} - [Besides, aren't you already cast as the lead in the spring play?]\n{d16.3} - [You don't have to be in everything, Carly.]\n{d17.1} - [But how does that help me? I love theatre, but I want to major in Computer Science!]\n{d18.1} - [Listen, Miss Reynolds. I am sorry that you did not make the cut. Truly, I am. But ambushing me like this and complaining about it is not going to change that fact. Now if you'll excuse me...]\n{d19.1} - [Carly! Tell me everything. How'd it go? Did you make it?]\n{d20.1} - [What do you mean]\n{d20.2} - [?]\n{d21.1} - [Unbelievable. You're not on the team? Oh, Carly. I am so sorry. Here, come sit down and tell me what happened.]\n{d22.1} - [So...]\n{d23.1} - [I don't know, Ms. Alexandria. I did everything that I was supposed to, I had the top score on three of the last four exams, and I worked so hard on my essay-]\n{d24.1} - [I know you did. I read it, remember? It was brilliant.]\n{d25.1} - [Clearly not brilliant enough.]\n{d26.1} - [Oh, Carly. I have been at this job for longer than you could imagine, and I'd be hard pressed to find anyone more deserving of that spot than you.]\n{d27.1} - [Except Mike Landry or Logan Pruitt.]\n{d28.1} - [Mike Landry? That's who they put on the team?]\n{d28.2} - [Unbelievable. I've spent more time kicking that boy out of here for using the lab computers for Facebook than seeing him actually do anything productive. Carly Reynolds, you have Mike Landry outmatched tenfold.]\n{d29.1} - [That's not what Mr. Paxton said.]\n{d30.1} - [Mr. Paxton? He talked with you about it?]\n{d31.1} - [Not exactly. After seeing the list, I asked him what I could do to improve my chances in the future, and he said nothing. That I was a great candidate, but that I should try again next year and just be happy with my theatre role.]\n{d32.1} - [But you don't want to study theatre.]\n{d33.1} - [I know.]\n{d34.1} - [You're applying for computer science.]\n{d35.1} - [That's what I told him.]\n{d36.1} - [Unbelievable. A young woman like yourself can have more than one interest. Ooh that really frosts my pumpkin. I suppose he said nothing about the fact that Mike is also on the wrestling team?]\n{d37.1} - [Why should that matter?]\n{d38.1} - [It shouldn't. That's the point. And neither should your acting. This double standard that men can have a dozen passions, but women can't possibly be good at art AND science is outrageous. You know what? This is Hedy Lamarr all over again.]\n{d39.1} - [Who?]\n{d40.1} - [Hedy Lamarr.]\n{d41.1} - [You don't know who Hedy Lamarr is?]\n{d42.1} - [No, should I? Was she some kind of scientist?]\n{d43.1} - [An inventor. An actress.]\n{d44.1} - [Like, she plays an inventor on TV?]\n{d45.1} - [No! She was a brilliant inventor who also just happened to be a world famous actress.]\n{d46.1} - [I think that there's something you need to see.]\n{d47.1} - [Has this always been here? I've never noticed this area before.]\n{d48.1} - [You'd be surprised at what people overlook even if it's right out in the open. Ah! Here it is.]\n{d49.1} - [I have to head back to the front and make sure that none of the freshmen boys are daring each other to flip open one of the anatomy textbooks, but you take a few minutes and look this over. I'm curious as to what you will find.]\n{d50.1} - [Mr. Carter! This is a library! You will show some respect or...]\n{d51.1} - [I hate that picture of me.]\n{d52.1} - [What?! Who are you?!]\n{d53.1} - [Why, shouldn't that be obvious? I'm on the cover of the book you are holding in your hands. Now that is a good picture of me.]\n{d54.1} - [Very funny. Did Ms. Alexandria put you up to this?]\n{d55.1} - [I haven't a clue what you are talking about.]\n{d56.1} - [Well tell her I appreciate the effort, but this is a little bit overboard.]\n{d56.2} - [What do you want?]\n{d57.1} - [What do I want? You're the one who came to me. You took my book off the shelf and opened it. I should be asking what it is that you want.]\n{d58.1} - [I think I want to leave.]\n{d59.1} - [Fine. So be it. Just be sure to put my book back on the shelf before you go.]\n{d60.1} - [Wait. You invented Bluetooth?]\n{d60.2} - [I mean, Hedy Lamarr invented Bluetooth?]\n{d61.1} - [No.]\n{d62.1} - [Not specifically Bluetooth. But the patent my partner and I were awarded for Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum did lay the groundwork for it.]\n{d63.1} - [That is so cool! So what was it used for then, if it wasn't meant for that?]\n{d64.1} - [I thought you didn't believe me, and that you wanted to leave?]\n{d65.1} - [Well I still don't actually think you are the real Hedy Lamarr]\n{d65.2} - [considering that right here it mentions she passed away in 2000.]\n{d66.1} - [Well then I'll just have to prove it to you. You want to know my story? I'll show you.]\n{d67.1} - [When I was a little girl, my father and I would walk along the streets of Vienna, and he would point out something along the way, like a streetcar, and he would explain to me all the little pieces that would go into making it work.]\n{d68.1} - [Although my mind loved learning how things work,]\n{d68.2} - [growing up in Vienna during that age, my heart led me to the stage, and after that, to film.]\n{d69.1} - [That is until my first husband was so embarrassed by my debut film that he tried to buy up every single copy of the film, forbade me from pursuing acting, and made me a prisoner of our own home.]\n{d70.1} - [So I stayed home, while he socialized with and sold weapons to some of the most despicable people in history. And while they talked, and talked. I listened and learned.]\n{d71.1} - [Until I thought of a way out. One night, while everyone was distracted, I made my move.]\n{d72.1} - [You drugged the maid and snuck away?]\n{d73.1} - [I needed to get out of there. I saw a way, so I took it. I eventually made my way to Paris, and then, to America to work in Hollywood.]\n{d74.1} - [Then one night, at a dinner party, I met my future collaborator, George Antheil. By now, World War 2 had been going on for a few years, and the US Government decided to ask for help in solving a few problems they were coming up against. George and I started talking about one in particular.]\n{d75.1} - [The Navy had torpedoes that were strong enough to incapacitate the enemy's ships, but they were found to be pretty easy to jam and set off course. Fortunately for them, I spent a lot of time listening in on my ex-husband's weapons plans, and with George's help, I now had an idea of how to stop them.]\n{d76.1} - [Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum.]\n{d77.1} - [Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum. Instead of a ship being able to jam the signal for an incoming torpedo, this method used the same technology as a player piano, and caused the torpedo to jump frequencies, essentially rendering any current jamming techniques obsolete.]\n{d78.1} - [That is so awesome! So was this one of the turning points of the war?]\n{d79.1} - [Not even a little bit. The Navy wasn't quite desperate enough to try and use a new invention from a Hollywood Actress and Composer. They told me that I would be of greater service if I would use my fame to try and help sell War Bonds.]\n{d80.1} - [Did you?]\n{d81.1} - [Of course I did! This was at the peak of one of the greatest tragedies in all of humanity. Was I upset that they didn't want to use my new invention? You bet I was. But you forget, I met the men that we were fighting against, and I was willing to help in any way that I could. Even if I had to stand in front of crowd and ask for money.]\n{d81.2} - [. One night, I said anyone who purchased more than $25,000 worth of bonds would get a kiss from me. I single handedly raised over $7 million dollars in that one night.]\n{d82.1} - [Wow.]\n{d82.2} - [So what happened with your patent?]\n{d83.1} - [It expired. Eventually the government did try our method a few decades later in the Cuban Missile Crisis, and in the 90s, a group of companies got together and expanded on the basic idea to create WiFi,]\n{d83.2} - [Bluetooth, and even GPS.]\n{d84.1} - [Did they give you credit?]\n{d85.1} - [George and I did win a couple of awards years later, but it would have been nice to have been seen as more than just glamorous back then. As I've always said, any girl can be glamorous. All you have to do is stand still and look stupid.]\n{d86.1} - [I can see why Ms. Alexandria thought our situations were similar.]\n{d87.1} - [Oh yeah? You once had to steal away in the middle of the night to escape a tyrannical jailer?]\n{d88.1} - [No. But I was just told by the head of the science department that I should be happy with being in the school play instead of being on the S.T.E.M. team. Instead he accepted two guys who barely know what they are doing. I won't be able to compete this year, and after seeing the way our talk went, I am not so sure I will next year either.]\n{d89.1} - [Well you know what you need to do now, right?]\n{d90.1} - [See if there is any way that I can still help, even if it's not in the way that I want?]\n{d91.1} - [What are you, crazy? This isn't The War. No. You sit back and laugh as they struggle to accomplish half of what they would have if they had brought you on, and in the meantime, you hone your craft and next year you make it so they have no choice but to put you on the team where you belong.]\n{d92.1} - [I'm sorry, kid. I wish I could tell you this will get better.]\n{d92.2} - [That over time, people will change and that someday, you will get the recognition you deserve. But if history is any sign, we're still a long way from that.]\n{d93.1} - [Wait! Here. Check this out and read it when you have some time at home.]\n{d94.1} - [Rosalind Franklin? Who is she?]\n{d95.1} - [I'll let her tell you that one.]\n{d96.1} - [I don't think I will ever get used to that.]\n{d97.1} - [If it makes you feel any better, I can promise you that it's just as weird on our side. All of a sudden being thrust into existence in an unknown environment.]\n{d98.1} - [Oh. I didn't even think about that. I'm sorry.]\n{d99.1} - [It doesn't hurt to always try and see things from another's point of view. You might learn something.]\n{d100.1} - [I'll remember that.]\n{d100.2} - [So, what's your story.]\n{d101.1} - [You're holding my book, are you not? And you can read, correct?]\n{d102.1} - [So you worked with x-ray crystallography?]\n{d103.1} - [And other things.]\n{d104.1} - [I honestly have no idea what that is.]\n{d105.1} - [For simplicity, let's just say I worked with enlarged photographs of very tiny structures.]\n{d106.1} - [Like... DNA for example?]\n{d107.1} - [Like DNA for example.]\n{d108.1} - [I also did groundbreaking work on understanding the molecular structures of coal, and made numerous strides in my research on a variety of viruses, but no one ever finds those bits as interesting, do they? No, it's all about \"Photo 51\" with them nowadays.]\n{d109.1} - [Can't say I blame them, really. The story almost seems too scandalous not to tell. But the whole thing is rather a bit silly if you ask me.]\n{d109.2} - [I'm sorry. I should let you read.]\n{d110.1} - [You know what really gets me, though? I was ready to move past the whole thing. Let bygones be bygones. But then that rat Watson had to go and write about me in his book like I was the villain. Like it was me who was the incompetent one. He just couldn't leave it be.]\n{d111.1} - [Why don't you show me what happened?]\n{d112.1} - [No, no. Research shows you retain more when you read.]\n{d113.1} - [Are you sure? Because I really think hearing it from you would be the best way to make sure I get the whole thing.]\n{d114.1} - [Well, if you're going to be so insistent about it, then I can't change your mind. Here.]\n{d115.1} - [You've heard of James Watson and Francis Crick?]\n{d116.1} - [The guys who discovered DNA?]\n{d117.1} - [Right, just like how Columbus discovered America.]\n{d117.2} - [Something worth remembering, in the scientific community, we all stand on each other's shoulders.]\n{d118.1} - [A couple of years after graduating with my Ph.D in Physical Chemistry from Cambridge University, I was offered a position at King's College as the head Research Associate. DNA was determined to be the next best thing, and my supervisor decided my talents would best be used trying to identify the structure. I was even given a Ph.D. student to assist me in my work.]\n{d119.1} - [What I didn't know, what my supervisor failed to inform me about, was that both my new lab, and my assistant, had previously been assigned to another Research Associate, Maurice Wilkins.]\n{d120.1} - [He was on Holiday when I moved in, and, well, I don't think he was quite thrilled at the idea of working alongside a woman who was so assertive. I, on the other hand, could not have cared less. I was on a mission to discover the structure of DNA, and I wasn't going to sit back and let some man with half my talent, and much less experience delay me simply because his ego couldn't handle it.]\n{d121.1} - [While I continued to work on my research at King's College, an hour up the road two other scientists were also on the hunt back at Cambridge.]\n{d122.1} - [Watson and Crick?]\n{d123.1} - [Except they weren't doing exactly the same work.]\n{d123.2} - [Whereas, I was of the belief that experimentation, trial and error, and perseverance were the best avenues for scientific progress, Watson and Crick were so determined to be the first, that they often took shortcuts.]\n{d124.1} - [So much so, that in a desperate and ultimately foolish attempt at subterfuge, Watson once snuck into a presentation of mine where I posited that DNA likely had two strands in its form. He then tried to relay all of the information back to Crick. Together they attempted to build a model of what DNA looks like, based primarily off of my presentation, but Watson didn't take notes, and their model had three strands.]\n{d125.1} - [Over the next year, things worsened as the boys club that was London at the time started to grow more and more hostile.]\n{d125.2} - [They started calling me \"Rosy\" and \"The Dark Lady\" behind my back, but I pushed through and kept at my work, knowing that was the only true way to uncovering the truth of DNA. Around this time, my assistant and I took many photos, one of which was the infamous \"Photo 51\". At the time, I had no idea what we had in our hands, so I put it aside for future analysis.]\n{d126.1} - [And that is the photo that led to discovering the structure of DNA?]\n{d127.1} - [It was.]\n{d128.1} - [So how did Watson and Crick get a hold of it?]\n{d129.1} - [Remember my lab partner? Maurice Wilkins?]\n{d130.1} - [Yeah?]\n{d131.1} - [It turns out he was good friends with Francis Crick,]\n{d131.2} - [and he had been feeding them information, and with the race to being the first so tight, Watson came to me and pleaded for me to help him and Crick.]\n{d132.1} - [So you gave them the photo?]\n{d133.1} - [Not a chance! I was so furious that he thought I was about to hit him and he ran away.]\n{d134.1} - [On his way out, however, it seems he ran into his friend Wilkins, who had recently stumbled upon \"Photo 51\". He showed it to Watson, who immediately copied the image and returned to his partner in crime, Crick.]\n{d135.1} - [They stole your work?]\n{d136.1} - [I didn't know that at the time. I just assumed they had stumbled upon a working hypothesis, and when they showed me their new model, I had to admit, it looked like they were on to something. It wasn't until years after my death, when Watson wrote that scathing excuse for a book of his, that anyone really noticed they directly used any of my research at all.]\n{d137.1} - [And they got away with it?]\n{d138.1} - [Got away with it? They were awarded the Nobel Prize for it in 1962!]\n{d139.1} - [Shouldn't it have at the very least been shared with you?]\n{d140.1} - [Many think it wasn't possible because the Nobel Prize can't be awarded to someone who has already passed away, and since I died in 1958, I wasn't eligible. But that rule didn't come into effect until 1974, twelve years after they won the award. A different rule,]\n{d140.2} - [however, states that no more than three people can share the prize.]\n{d141.1} - [Watson and Crick shared the award with third person? Who?]\n{d142.1} - [No.]\n{d143.1} - [Wilkins?!]\n{d144.1} - [Watson insisted that he be included. I guess it only makes sense, as the whole thing never would have happened without him.]\n{d144.2} - [This way all three colluders get equal recognition.]\n{d145.1} - [I am so sorry that happened to you.]\n{d146.1} - [No use stressing over it now. Not much I can do about it. Not with my... condition.]\n{d147.1} - [What did you do next?]\n{d148.1} - [Next, I decided to leave King's College and DNA behind me. I moved on to a new university and research project. I learned that it was often better to focus on the present than the past.]\n{d149.1} - [Is that what I should do too? Forget about this whole thing and move on, like you did?]\n{d150.1} - [I moved on because I didn't fully know what had happened until it was too late.]\n{d151.1} - [You just told me to focus on the present, not the past.]\n{d152.1} - [So do that.]\n{d153.1} - [But... wait, I'm confused. Isn't \"not making the team\" in the past?]\n{d154.1} - [You didn't make the team, yes that's the past.]\n{d154.2} - [Nothing you can do about that. But that doesn't mean you can't work to fix the outcome. This team. Do they have meetings?]\n{d155.1} - [Yeah. I think they have the first one tomorrow afternoon.]\n{d156.1} - [Is there anything in the rules that says you can't be in the room?]\n{d157.1} - [It's implied that only those on the team ca-]\n{d158.1} - [If you live your entire life by following implied rules, you are not going to get very far. If they don't want you in that room,]\n{d158.2} - [they will have to point to a clear reason why you should not be allowed.]\n{d158.3} - [Don't let them off easy. They're going to have to work for it if they are going to try and hold you back.]\n{d159.1} - [So I should just show up at the meeting anyway?]\n{d160.1} - [Is there somewhere else you need to be?]\n{d161.1} - [Not really. I had originally planned to be there. I set my entire schedule around that.]\n{d162.1} - [Well, couldn't hurt to show up and see what you can do, right? At the very least, it will show how dedicated you are.]\n{d163.1} - [Okay. Yeah, you know what, I'm sure Mr. Paxton would be fine with that, right? As long as I'm not distracting the group.]\n{d163.2} - [Thank you.]\n{d164.1} - [Say, are you going back to the library tomorrow?]\n{d165.1} - [Then take a look at these. I think they might give you some added perspective.]\n{d166.1} - [Barbara McClintock and Rosalyn Yalow? Never heard of them.]\n{d167.1} - [Well trust me, they are well worth hearing about.]\n{d168.1} - [Okay. I'll do that. Thank you. I wish I could do something for you in return.]\n{d169.1} - [It's no problem, really. Just whatever you do, don't give up. That will be how you can repay me. Deal?]\n{d170.1} - [Deal.]\n{d171.1} - [Miss Reynolds, I'm sorry, we're just about to start our meeting.]\n{d172.1} - [I know. That's why I'm here.]\n{d173.1} - [Look, I know you are not happy with my decision,]\n{d173.2} - [but I thought we were on the same page that you did not make the team this year.]\n{d174.1} - [Oh, I know I am not on the team.]\n{d175.1} - [You do?]\n{d176.1} - [I do. And I completely understand.]\n{d177.1} - [Oh. Well, I am glad to hear that. Now if you would exc-]\n{d178.1} - [But I also know that if I want to make the team next time, I need to learn more about what it takes. So I figured that I could sit in on the meetings and learn something.]\n{d179.1} - [I see. that's very... forward thinking of you. However, I don't think that's the best use of your time, do you?]\n{d180.1} - [How would it be any different than if I had been asked to be on the team? Actually, since I won't be needing to work on anything to contribute to the team, it is less work than if I was on the team.]\n{d181.1} - [Don't you also have rehearsals starting soon? Maybe you should just try and focus on one thing at a time.]\n{d182.1} - [At least half of the them also wrestle. If they can do more than one activity, shouldn't I be able to?]\n{d183.1} - [I just don't think it's a good precedent to set. If we let one student sit in on a meeting, next thing we know, every group will have too many students, and we do not have the budget to hire extra staff, and--]\n{d184.1} - [So the result of the precedent that you are afraid to set is that too many students will be interested in learning more?]\n{d185.1} - [I am sorry. It is just not the way we do things.]\n{d186.1} - [Why?]\n{d187.1} - [Why what.]\n{d188.1} - [Why do we do things only one way? Shouldn't we be open to learning from our experiences? Isn't that what science is really all about?]\n{d189.1} - [I've already told you why, Miss Reynolds.]\n{d190.1} - [But you haven't. You listed some made up reason that makes no sense. If you really wanted to--]\n{d191.1} - [MISS Reynolds. I have had about enough of this discussion.]\n{d191.2} - [If you continue to ignore my decision, you will find that it is very difficult to attend rehearsals when you are stuck in detention. Now if you'll please excuse us, we have a meeting to start.]\n{d192.1} - [And don't make me come back over there, or you'll be banned for a week!]\n{d192.2} - [Carly! What a wonderful surprise!]\n{d192.3} - [Twice in one week, why if that isn't a raisin in the sausage, I don't know what is.]\n{d192.4} - [How are you doing?]\n{d193.1} - [Honestly, Ms. Alexandria, I've been better, but I have recently been told that it's better to focus on the things we can change, and not dwell on those that we can't.]\n{d194.1} - [That sounds like some pretty sound advice. I'm sure whoever gave you that to you really knew what she was talking about.]\n{d195.1} - [She really did.]\n{d195.2} - [For now though, I'm just returning this book,]\n{d195.3} - [and... maybe checking out a few more]\n{d196.1} - [Fantastic! I knew you would like that section.]\n{d196.2} - [So many great stories that never get heard.]\n{d197.1} - [Were you able to relate with this one a little bit?]\n{d198.1} - [Uh, I guess you could say it really spoke to me.]\n{d199.1} - [All the best books do.]\n{d200.1} - [You haven't ever noticed... something different about the books from that shelf have you?]\n{d201.1} - [Different? How so?]\n{d202.1} - [Like, they feel a bit more \"real\" than some of the other books I've checked out in the past.]\n{d203.1} - [Biographies often feel that way. That's why so many movies advertise that they are \"based on a true story\", we all love a good story, but we love it even more when it is something that supposedly actually happened. Most of the time, anyway.]\n{d204.1} - [I guess. These just feel like there is a little more to them than meets the eye.]\n{d205.1} - [I have spent more years than you would ever believe around libraries, and if there is anything that I have learned, it's that there is always more to a story than appears at first glance. Books are magical like that.]\n{d206.1} - [You said there were some more books you wanted to check out?]\n{d207.1} - [Oh, yes! Barbara McClintock and Rosalyn Yalow?]\n{d208.1} - [Oooh! Those are some heavy hitters. Do you remember where to go? Or do you need help finding it?]\n{d209.1} - [I think I can find the way. Thanks though. I suddenly have an opening in my schedule, so I might just end up finding a quiet, empty spot. You know, just in case I feel like... thinking out loud?]\n{d210.1} - [Sounds great! Well you know where to find me if you need any help.]\n{d211.1} - [How is she doing? Really.]\n{d212.1} - [She's taking it pretty hard, but there's still a fire in her. Hopefully, Barbara and Rosalyn can fan the flames a little bit.]\n{d213.1} - [Let's hope so.]\n{d214.1} - [Well she can't just sit back and not try something.]\n{d215.1} - [I know that. I am just saying that in certain situations, like the one Carly appears to be in, there are other ways to accomplish one's goals other than just brute force.]\n{d216.1} - [Like what?]\n{d217.1} - [Yeah, like what?]\n{d218.1} - [Well, she could start her own club. I am sure that there are other qualified students who would love to get together and work on projects.]\n{d219.1} - [It's not just some club. The S.T.E.M. team gets to travel to the capital each spring and compete. They give out scholarships to the winners, and it looks really good on my transcript.]\n{d220.1} - [I still say you just go in there again, and make them take you out. So what if he gives you detention? You serve it and then go back next week and do it again. What is he going to do? kick you out of school for trying to learn?]\n{d221.1} - [He might.]\n{d222.1} - [Then you'll go somewhere else. Somewhere that they appreciate the talent they have.]\n{d223.1} - [Rosalyn, I do not think getting Carly expelled from school is the best way to help her succeed.]\n{d224.1} - [Sitting around and waiting for someone to recognize her talent isn't going to be of much help either, Barbara. This isn't like your research. Someone isn't going to finally discover twenty years down the road that Carly Reynolds is the best match for the team unless she finds a way to show them first.]\n{d225.1} - [Wait, what about twenty years?]\n{d226.1} - [She is talking about my research on jumping genes.]\n{d227.1} - [My research showed that certain genes can sometimes \"jump\" from one part of a chromosome to another. It's what is largely responsible for variation between generations. However, when I showed my work, the entire community thought it was absurd and it went mainly ignored for a long time.]\n{d228.1} - [As in \"twenty years\" long time?]\n{d229.1} - [Something like that. But it didn't matter. I knew I was right, and when you know you're right, you don't care. I knew that time would validate my discovery. And it did.]\n{d229.2} - [I'll have you know that I won the Nobel Prize for that discovery.]\n{d230.1} - [You won a Nobel?]\n{d231.1} - [Yeah. Almost three decades after the fact. Just think of what else could have been accomplished in the field of genetics had your amazing discovery been accepted when it should have.]\n{d232.1} - [I can't change how others see the world. I am only in control of my own actions. Not everyone can pump out a dozen papers a year for half a decade. I admire your tenacity, but I'll take waiting patiently for my prize for 30 years rather than nearly working myself to death to get one in 5.]\n{d233.1} - [So you have one too?]\n{d234.1} - [She sure does. Rosalyn here is a major reason we know anything at all about diabetes today. She discovered how insulin works in the human body, and in turn taught the world the difference between type 1 and 2 diabetes.]\n{d234.2} - [We all have our own methods. I just happen to be a little more laid back in my approach.]\n{d235.1} - [Is that why you liked wearing pants all the time?]\n{d236.1} - [Pants? What's wrong with wearing pants?]\n{d237.1} - [In Barbara's day, women were thought of as \"troublemakers\" for wearing pants. It showed that they didn't exactly like following the rules.]\n{d238.1} - [They're comfy.]\n{d239.1} - [Still. None of this is going to help Carly right now. This world moves much faster than the worlds we come from. She can't just wait and hope to be noticed. She needs to take action.]\n{d240.1} - [So what do you suggest? That she sneaks in before they start, and hangs in the rafters to hear what is going on?]\n{d241.1} - [Okay, first, I only did that once. And second, seeing Enrico Fermi give a guest lecture was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I was not going to miss it for anything.]\n{d242.1} - [Wait, you hid in the rafters?]\n{d243.1} - [No, I didn't hide. There was just no more room, or so they said, so I improvised. I didn't let their useless reasons prevent me from accomplishing my goals. And neither should Carly.]\n{d244.1} - [Well, we don't exactly have rafters in our classrooms. It's more of a rec-]\n{d245.1} - [It's a metaphor. They told you that there is no room on the team, or as a reserve, correct?]\n{d246.1} - [Right.]\n{d247.1} - [Well then we just need to find a way to make some room.]\n{d248.1} - [But how?]\n{d249.1} - [How many people are on the team?]\n{d250.1} - [Any team that wishes to compete must have at least eight, and no more than twelve teammates. Our school currently has all twelve spots filled.]\n{d251.1} - [And how many of those spots are girls?]\n{d252.1} - [Currently? None.]\n{d253.1} - [Wait. Not one of the twelve spots on the team is a female student?]\n{d254.1} - [No.]\n{d255.1} - [I told you I can get it for y-]\n{d256.1} - [Oh, Hello.]\n{d257.1} - [Hi, Carly.]\n{d258.1} - [Uh, hi.]\n{d259.1} - [Mr. Paxton, please just wait here. If I have to show you to every spot, we'll be pedaling in yogurt. It's much easier for both of us if I just get the books you are looking for.]\n{d260.1} - [Doing some light reading, I see?]\n{d260.2} - [Rosalyn Yalow and Barbara McClintock?]\n{d261.1} - [Yes. I, uh, am doing a research paper on great scientists of the twentieth century.]\n{d262.1} - [Ah, I see.]\n{d262.2} - [Well, I would think you can find some better examples than these.]\n{d263.1} - [Why? What's wrong with them?]\n{d264.1} - [Oh, nothing is wrong with them. There are just much more interesting scientists you could research is all.]\n{d264.2} - [I'm sure you've heard about Watson and Crick? Now those two are worth the time to research if you ask me. They won the Nobel Prize for their work in discovering DNA,]\n{d264.3} - [did you know that?]\n{d265.1} - [Both of these scientists won a Nobel too.]\n{d266.1} - [Did they? Can't remember them all I suppose.]\n{d266.2} - [McClintock... She worked with corn, right?]\n{d266.3} - [Not quite as exciting as DNA, though, wouldn't you say?]\n{d267.1} - [Maybe not, but at least they didn't need to steal from others in order to win. I think I'll stick with what I have. Thank you though.]\n{d268.1} - [Ah, well. It's your paper.]\n{d269.1} - [Here you go.]\n{d269.2} - [Everything you could possibly need on the matter.]\n{d269.3} - [Is everything alright?]\n{d270.1} - [Yes. Of course. Thank you, Ms. Alexandria.]\n{d271.1} - [Let's head up to the front, and I'll get you checked out.]\n{d272.1} - [So that was him?]\n{d273.1} - [Yeah.]\n{d274.1} - [He would be a Watson fanboy.]\n{d274.2} - [What's this? Did he leave this behind?]\n{d275.1} - [Oh, I should run that-]\n{d276.1} - [Let's have a look inside!]\n{d277.1} - [No, we shouldn't do that. I could get in trouble.]\n{d278.1} - [Come on, Rosalyn. Let her bring it back to Mr.]\n{d278.2} - [Paxton.]\n{d279.1} - [Don't worry, we won't get caught. He can't see us,]\n{d279.2} - [remember?]\n{d279.3} - [Oh. What is this?]\n{d280.1} - [What?]\n{d281.1} - [Really. I could get in a lot of trouble.]\n{d282.1} - [Is that what I think it is?]\n{d283.1} - [His notes on everyone who tried out for the team?]\n{d284.1} - [What? He took notes?]\n{d285.1} - [Wow, he really didn't seem to care much for this Landry guy. Only positive thing he said here is that his brothers were both outstanding students.]\n{d286.1} - [He got in because of his brothers?]\n{d287.1} - [Looks like it.]\n{d288.1} - [What does it say about me?]\n{d289.1} - [Nothing. Nothing at all.]\n{d290.1} - [I'm not in there?]\n{d291.1} - [No, you're in here. But he didn't write anything about you. It's just blank.]\n{d292.1} - [But, that doesn't make any sense. He asked me a bunch of questions in the interview.]\n{d292.2} - [That's true for all of the girls in here. Just blank pages.]\n{d293.1} - [Just what exactly do you think you are doing, Miss Reynolds?]\n{d294.1} - [I.. Uh..]\n{d295.1} - [Did you take that out of my briefcase?]\n{d296.1} - [No! I mean, yes, but-]\n{d297.1} - [That is my personal property]\n{d297.2} - [and you have no right to be going through that.]\n{d298.1} - [I know. I am sorry. I just... I didn't mean to pry.]\n{d299.1} - [Mr. Paxton?]\n{d300.1} - [What is is?]\n{d301.1} - [Can I ask why you didn't have any notes for me?]\n{d302.1} - [What?]\n{d303.1} - [In the notebook. You had notes about most of the candidates, but mine you just left blank.]\n{d304.1} - [You are out of line Miss Reynolds. And frankly, I am getting sick and tired of having to justify my actions to you. I am the teacher here. You are the student. Which means you will show me a little respect. Do you understand?]\n{d305.1} - [Yes. It's just that-]\n{d306.1} - [It's just NOTHING. Starting tomorrow afternoon I will be seeing you after school in detention for the rest of the week. Maybe then you will learn to stop second guessing everything I do.]\n{d307.1} - [He can't do that!]\n{d308.1} - [I think he just did.]\n{d309.1} - [Carly, I didn't mean to get you in any more trouble...]\n{d310.1} - [No.]\n{d310.2} - [It's okay. I think that actually might have helped.]\n{d311.1} - [Helped? How so? You do know that you have detention for the rest of the week, right?]\n{d312.1} - [Yeah. But I think I have an idea.]\n{d312.2} - [I've got to go get a few things. Gather everyone else up, and wait here for me. I'll be right back.]\n{d313.1} - [Did she say where she was going?]\n{d314.1} - [No. She just told us to gather everyone up, and then she ran off.]\n{d315.1} - [I'm a bit worried about her.]\n{d316.1} - [I don't know. She seemed pretty excited about whatever it was that get her going.]\n{d317.1} - [But you said this Mr. Paxton really laid into her?]\n{d318.1} - [All because he caught her looking through a little notebook?]\n{d319.1} - [He really didn't like her seeing his notes from the interviews.]\n{d320.1} - [But why was she looking at it in the first place?]\n{d321.1} - [That would be my fault. I may have slightly encouraged that she take a peak.]\n{d322.1} - [Rosalyn...]\n{d323.1} - [I know, I know, but it helped to confirm what we all were already thinking.]\n{d324.1} - [He didn't even bother filling out a single piece of information about any of the girls that he interviewed.]\n{d325.1} - [So he just dismissed every single girl before they even met with him? How has no one else noticed this before?]\n{d326.1} - [He is the sole person responsible for interviewing students for the team, and since so many more boys than girls try out in the first place, no one even noticed that not a single girl has been given a shot.]\n{d327.1} - [Okay, so where is this book now?]\n{d328.1} - [He took it. And probably has already shred it by now if he has any brains at all.]\n{d329.1} - [Let's not go giving him too much credit, shall we? Isn't it best to actually see evidence of something before jumping to too many conclusions?]\n{d330.1} - [So we get it back. Right? We get the book and show it to the principal, and then they'll have no choice but to let Carly on the team?]\n{d331.1} - [It's not that simple. The team is already full.]\n{d331.2} - [They'd have to kick someone off to make room.]\n{d332.1} - [If anyone was chosen over Carly simply because Mr. Paxton doesn't like girls on his S.T.E.M. team, they don't deserve to be there in the first place.]\n{d333.1} - [But... how do you prove that.]\n{d334.1} - [The notebook!]\n{d335.1} - [Shows that Mr. Paxton didn't have much to say about his female students. It doesn't prove that she is more deserving or qualified.]\n{d336.1} - [But she is.]\n{d337.1} - [You know that. And I know that. We all know that. But a notebook with a few blank lines won't prove that to someone who doesn't know her. It's nothing Mr. Paxton can't easily explain away.]\n{d338.1} - [It would make him look bad, and put pressure on him to open the team up to girls in the future.]\n{d339.1} - [Sure. Maybe next year he takes on a girl just to prove he isn't showing favoritism. But it won't be Carly. Not after all of this.]\n{d339.2} - [Especially not if she finds a way to steal a notebook from him and turn it in.]\n{d340.1} - [It's still the right thing. Even if it doesn't get Carly what she wants. What she deserves. If it opens the door for the next girl in her shoes, shouldn't she at least try?]\n{d341.1} - [But how is that fair to Carly?]\n{d342.1} - [It isn't, but Barbara's right. It may not have been a walk in the park for any of us to get to where we did, but I bet it would have been a hundred times more difficult if those who came before us decided that it wasn't worth the struggle. Each of us benefited from a history of women standing up for what was right. Just as many today benefit because hard working and determined women like Barbara and Rosalyn kept grinding away, despite being told they were wrong. Because women like you and me stuck by our work, even when it was ripped away from us. I want Carly to get what she deserves just as much as the rest of you, but if we can't help her find a way onto that team, the least we can do is help her make sure that the next girl in line has a little less obstacles in her path.]\n{d343.1} - [Well let's hope that I don't have to make that choice.]\n{d344.1} - [Carly! Where have you been? Is everything alright?]\n{d345.1} - [Everything is great. I think I figured out a way to get on the team.]\n{d346.1} - [Really? How?]\n{d347.1} - [We've been looking at this all the wrong way.]\n{d348.1} - [How so?]\n{d349.1} - [We've been working on the assumption that there was a specific and logical reason that Mr. Paxton was not letting me on the team.]\n{d350.1} - [I'm not sure that we ever really considered logic to be one of Mr. Paxton's strongest features.]\n{d351.1} - [But that's it! I have. I've been thinking this whole time, that the head of a science team, must be rational and calculating. And as much, I have been trying to appeal to him with such in return.]\n{d352.1} - [And it hasn't worked.]\n{d353.1} - [And it hasn't worked!]\n{d354.1} - [You lost me.]\n{d355.1} - [Did you know that most schools have been evolving their science curriculum from S.T.E.M. to S.T.E.A.M.? The A standing for arts of course.]\n{d356.1} - [Adding arts to their science departments?]\n{d357.1} - [Precisely. The thought is that science needs ingenuity to thrive.]\n{d357.2} - [That without abstract thought and creativity, science is forced to live in a vacuum, just repeating the same process over and over.]\n{d358.1} - [How exactly does this help your situation?]\n{d359.1} - [Let's just say that I have decided to get a little creative and put some of my other talents to use.]\n{d360.1} - [Mr. Paxton? There seems to be a-]\n{d360.2} - [Oh,]\n{d360.3} - [hello Carly! What are you doing here?]\n{d361.1} - [She, is serving out detention for disrespecting faculty. Now was there something I can help you with, Ms. Alexandria?]\n{d362.1} - [Oh, yes!]\n{d362.2} - [Sorry, I get a bit distracted from time to time. My mind is like an old lighthouse, always shining, but not always in the right direction. You know what I mean?]\n{d363.1} - [I'm sure that I don't. Now what was it that I could help you with?]\n{d364.1} - [Right! I was just in the front office, and since they knew that I'd be coming this way, asked if I could let you know that you have an urgent phone call.]\n{d365.1} - [If it was so urgent, why didn't they just page me over the intercom?]\n{d366.1} - [You got me! I'm just delivering the message. See you later!]\n{d366.2} - [You too, Carly!]\n{d367.1} - [I will only be gone for a few minutes. You are to stay in your seat and wait for me to return. Do you understand me?]\n{d368.1} - [If I discover that you so much as walked to throw something away, you will get another day's detention for every inch you step. Now take out your homework and get started. You're going to be here for awhile.]\n{d369.1} - [Come on, come on, where are you?]\n{d370.1} - [I have no idea what that batty libr-]\n{d371.1} - [Have you learned nothing?]\n{d372.1} - [I.. Uh.. was.. I.. um.. was just looking for-]\n{d373.1} - [I.. Uh.. was.. I.. um..]\n{d373.2} - [were looking for what? This?]\n{d374.1} - [Was that your big plan? Get your little librarian friend to come in here and make up some excuse about an urgent call so that you could try and rummage through my belongings... Again?]\n{d375.1} - [I wasn't rummaging, I was looking for something specific.]\n{d376.1} - [For what? My notebook? And what exactly did you plan on doing with that?]\n{d377.1} - [I was going to show it to Principal Swanson. Show her why I really didn't make the team.]\n{d378.1} - [Is that all?]\n{d378.2} - [Here. Go ahead. By all means, steal my \"secret\" notebook and show Principal Swanson just all the bad things I wrote about you.]\n{d379.1} - [Oh. What's that? I didn't actually write anything bad about you? What could that possibly mean?]\n{d380.1} - [We both know it means you were never intended to give me a chance in the first place.]\n{d381.1} - [Because of course it couldn't mean that you weren't just good enough, right? That you, little miss Carly Reynolds, might just not have what it takes to be a scientist. Right?!]\n{d382.1} - [If that were the case, then you would hav-]\n{d383.1} - [Oh, spare me the old wounded little girl routine. It isn't fooling anyone. I've seen it a hundred times before, and I'm sure I'll see it a hundred more from students like you.]\n{d384.1} - [Students like me?]\n{d385.1} - [Yes. Students like you. Little girls who come in here, and think that they are entitled to whatever it is that they want just because \"women's lib\" happened fifty years ago. Well I've got news for you, Honey.]\n{d385.2} - [I'm not buying it. You aren't getting special treatment from me just because you cry when someone tells you no.]\n{d386.1} - [I don't want special treatment. I just want to be given the same opportunity as everyone else. I want what is fair.]\n{d387.1} - [What's fair? If things were fair, I would be tenured at a university somewhere, instead of stuck teaching foundational scientific principles to a group of ungrateful tweens for scraps. If fairness mattered,]\n{d387.2} - [I wouldn't have been passed over again and again by woman after woman just so some chemistry department could meet their gender quota.]\n{d388.1} - [But it's not just women.]\n{d389.1} - [What?]\n{d390.1} - [Those departments, they aren't run by only women. They still have men, don't they? You were also passed over by all those men! You're just taking it out on the women because you can't come to terms with what it all really means. That you were the one who wasn't good enough.]\n{d391.1} - [I wasn't good enough?]\n{d392.1} - [No. You weren't. And you still aren't. And the only way you know how to deal with that sense of failure is to treat female students how you believe you were once treated. Except the only difference is whereas I was never even given the chance to succeed, you, on the other hand, were, yet you still failed anyway.]\n{d393.1} - [I did not fail!]\n{d393.2} - [They stole it from me!]\n{d394.1} - [Have you heard enough yet?]\n{d394.2} - [Please tell me someone was watching this.]\n{d395.1} - [What are you-]\n{d396.1} - [(V.O.) Mr. Paxton, please report directly to my office.]\n{d397.1} - [Mrs. Swanson? I'm sort of in the mid-]\n{d398.1} - [(V.O.) I know exactly what you are in the middle of.

Immediately.]\n{d399.1} - [“To Carly, From Your Biggest Fan.”]\n{d399.2} - [“Hypatia of Alexandria”?]\n{d400.1} - [I see you received my package.]\n{d401.1} - [So you can see all of the other women, too.]\n{d402.1} - [I never said that I couldn't.]\n{d403.1} - [You also never said that you were...]\n{d403.2} - [over sixteen hundred years old!]\n{d404.1} - [We all have a few of our own little secrets.]\n{d405.1} - [Little? You know, for a librarian, you sure play fast and loose with the definitions of words.]\n{d406.1} - [I was never really big in the languages. I was always more interested in Math and Astronomy.]\n{d407.1} - [So, what's next for Carly Reynolds?]\n{d408.1} - [Well, after yesterday's events, Principal Swanson called in my parents, and the four of us had a long hard talk this afternoon.]\n{d409.1} - [A positive one, I hope?]\n{d410.1} - [Mostly. Turns out that even when you're in the middle of catching your teacher in a full fledged misogynistic rant, the school district still isn't too keen on students hijacking the school feed to record one of their employees.]\n{d411.1} - [You don't say?]\n{d411.2} - [I hope you aren't in too much trouble?]\n{d412.1} - [No. Considering the circumstances, they pretty much just made me promise to never do that again, while they take the opportunity to upgrade their security software for the first time in the past decade.]\n{d413.1} - [That's probably for the best.]\n{d414.1} - [I also heard that Mr. Paxton was placed on administrative leave for the foreseeable future, which means the S.T.E.M. team will likely be on hiatus until he comes back. I'm sorry that after all this, it seems you're right back to where you started.]\n{d415.1} - [Not exactly...]\n{d416.1} - [Oh?]\n{d417.1} - [At our meeting earlier, we talked about what should be done in the spirit of fairness. Principal Swanson offered me a spot on the team, pushing one of the other guys to a reserve spot-]\n{d418.1} - [Carly! That's gre-]\n{d419.1} - [BUT... I said no.]\n{d420.1} - [You did?]\n{d421.1} - [I did. I told her it has never been about me being given a spot. I just want a chance to earn it. She thought that was a fair demand, and agreed to hold new interviews for the team, as long as they can find an interim coach.]\n{d422.1} - [Do they have anyone in mind?]\n{d423.1} - [...maybe you could do it?]\n{d424.1} - [I know it's more work for you, and that you're technically not a science teacher, but considering what you've been hiding, I think you'd be able to handle it pretty easily.]\n{d425.1} - [Can I think about it?]\n{d426.1} - [Of course! No pressure. I just... I think you'd be a great S.T.E.M. team coach.]\n{d427.1} - [S.T.E.A.M.]\n{d428.1} - [Huh?]\n{d429.1} - [S.T.E.A.M. team coach. If I were to take the position, and I'm not saying that I am, but IF I were, I think it's about time we update things around here a little bit, don't you?]\n{d430.1} - [I like that.]\n{d431.1} - [Keep it for a bit. You know where it goes.]\n{d432.1} - [Ms. Alexand-... I mean, Hypatia?]\n{d433.1} - [Yes?]\n{d434.1} - [Thank you.]\n{d435.1} - [For what?]\n{d436.1} - [For doing all of this. For helping me. For, I don't know, being some sort of magical sciency godmother.]\n{d437.1} - [You know that's not really a thing, right?]\n{d438.1} - [Whatever it is. Thank you.]\n{d439.1} - [You're welcome. Now go. Get out of here. I have work to do. Believe it or not, I do have other students who need looking after.]\n{d440.1} - [I think I might stick around here for a little bit, if that's okay with you?]\n{d441.1} - [Don't stay too late. These will be here when you need them. They aren't going anywhere.]\n{d442.1} - [I don't know what on earth you are doing up there, but if you don't-]\n\nStage Directions\n{stgd3} - [(MR.
