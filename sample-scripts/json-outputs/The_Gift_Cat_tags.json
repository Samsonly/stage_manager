Bwawwff! I'm Pippi, the puppy! You want to know a secret? I have a special super-power. And, it's not that I can talk. All of the animals here can talk—at least to each other. My super-power is so special that even Stevie, my person, doesn't know what it is. She'll never know, but you will…watch and wait!]\n{d2.1} - [Oh, for pity sake! The plastic bag the rice comes in just broke and now there's rice all over everything. As if I didn't already have enough to do.]\n{d2.2} - [What's all the racket about, Stevie?]\n{d3.1} - [I'm looking for something and it's really, really important.]\n{d4.1} - [Well, could you look a little more quietly, please. I have a headache.]\n{d5.1} - [I can't find it, Pip. I've looked everywhere. My money's gone.]\n{d6.1} - [What am I gonna do, Pip? I promised Mom FOUR presents for her birthday and now I can't find my money anywhere and I had a bunch of it, too.]\n{d7.1} - [What is it girl? You have an idea?]\n{d8.1} - [What is it Pip? Why are you howling?]\n{d9.1} - [Stop that, Pip. Mom has a headache.]\n{d9.2} - [Wait! I forgot to look in all my pants pockets! Good dog! I'm going to go look in all my pants pockets!]\n{d10.1} - [Gift Horse. I'm calling you!!]\n{d11.1} - [Oh, be quiet.]\n{d12.1} - [Why so rude? After all, you invited me.]\n{d13.1} - [What! I did not!]\n{d14.1} - [Did too!]\n{d15.1} - [Did not!]\n{d16.1} - [Did too!]\n{d17.1} - [Did not! I invited the Gift Horse.]\n{d18.1} - [Well, you got me. The Horse is busy. Howdie-do. I'm the Gift Cat.]\n{d18.2} - [What do you need.]\n{d19.1} - [I need the Gift Horse. You know to help with gifts.]\n{d20.1} - [Well, boo-hoo, you got me. Get on with it. I haven't got all day.]\n{d21.1} - [My person, Stevie, lost her money and…]\n{d22.1} - [Wait! Where are you going?]\n{d23.1} - [I'm the Gift Cat. Not the Lost-And-Found Cat. Catchya later, dude.]\n{d24.1} - [Use your words, dog.]\n{d25.1} - [Stevie, my person needs you. She lost their money and she needs FOUR birthday presents for her Mom.]\n{d26.1} - [Well, unfortunately, I'm fresh out of presents and money.]\n{d27.1} - [Like this scarf? I just got it. TJ MAX $14.99!]\n{d28.1} - [You spent the Gift Horse's money on presents for yourself!!]\n{d29.1} - [All right. I shouldn't have done that. Give me a minute I'll think of something the kid can give the Mom.]\n{d29.2} - [Uhhmm…Ahh…]\n{d30.1} - [Well?]\n{d31.1} - [I can't think like this. Quit growling at me!!]\n{d32.1} - [Well, help me think. I'm sure you could help. I heard somewhere that dogs are smarter than cats. You know? Please, oh please oh please stop growling so I can think.]\n{d33.1} - [All right, then.]\n{d33.2} - [Let's think!]\n{d34.1} - [You could give me a hand here.]\n{d35.1} - [My nails aren't dry.]\n{d36.1} - [Stop. Stop that. Stop with the irresistible puppy stuff. Fine. I'll help.]\n{d37.1} - [There!]\n{d38.1} - [There what?]\n{d39.1} - [Don't you see? We can REUSE these. They can be presents.]\n{d40.1} - [Presents?!! That is junk, garbage, trash. I'm leaving.]\n{d41.1} - [All right, fine, I'm staying...]\n{d42.1} - [Good. I'll get Stevie.]\n{d43.1} - [What is it, girl? Oh no, Pippi, what's all this trash doing out? Mom won't like this!]\n{d44.1} - [There it is--my super-power. See?! I can make everything stop and then, I can give people ideas. Cool, huh. If you can think of something here on the table that Stevie could REUSE! something that could hold uncooked rice. Something Stevie could decorate and REUSE as a gift for her Mom-- please raise your hand and I'll call on you.]\n{d44.2} - [Good thinking. I'll give Stevie that idea.]\n{d45.1} - [Wait a minute, there's treasure in this trash. My Mom just spilled rice all over the floor 'cause the bag it came in broke. I could REUSE this coffee can. I can decorate it and she could put her rice in it! AND I could give it to her for her birthday!!]\n{d45.2} - [REUSE! REUSING is REDUCING. Yes.]\n{d46.1} - [But that's not enough. I told Mom I'd be giving her FOUR presents.]\n{d46.2} - [and I don't see anything else here I can give her. Oh, no.]\n{d47.1} - [Stevie needs another idea. If we REUSE stuff, then we can REDUCE how much new stuff has to be made, reduce how much stuff goes into the trash!]\n{d47.2} - [If you think this can be REUSED as a present, raise your hand? Thank you, you can put your hands down. Maybe Stevie could paint this and her Mom could put something in it. Stevie's Mom could sort stuff in here. If you can think of something to put in here, besides eggs, raise your hand and I'll call on someone.]\n{d47.3} - [Okay, I'll give Stevie that idea.]\n{d48.1} - [Oh. I just had an idea! I could paint this and my Mom could put her jewelry, maybe earrings, in it!]\n{d48.2} - [Pippi, that's 2 presents! How many more do I need?]\n{d49.1} - [Huh.]\n{d49.2} - [This is hard.]\n{d50.1} - [Stevie, lunch!]\n{d51.1} - [Coming Mom!]\n{d52.1} - [Hhhmmm….]\n{d53.1} - [Fun!]\n{d54.1} - [Cat! What do you think you're doing?]\n{d55.1} - [What does it look like, dog. I'm leaving.]\n{d56.1} - [Not with that ribbon you're not. At least not without paying for it.]\n{d57.1} - [What?!! It's just ribbon trash.]\n{d58.1} - [No, it's not. It's a ribbon treasure—AND IT CAN BE REUSED to REDUCE WASTE! Pay up. 25 cents.]\n{d59.1} - [I thought you didn't have any money.]\n{d60.1} - [I'm a cat. Whattya think? Can I always be trusted?]\n{d61.1} - [Say, did you notice this bag of trash is getting smaller.]\n{d62.1} - [Duh…that's because we're REUSING a lot of it. REDUCES WASTE. It's good for the earth.]\n{d63.1} - [How do you know that?]\n{d64.1} - [I must have read it somewhere.]\n{d65.1} - [You can read! Seriously?!]\n{d66.1} - [No.]\n{d67.1} - [Good grief. I forgot. Cat.]\n{d68.1} - [How much for this blanket?]\n{d69.1} - [Two dollars.]\n{d70.1} - [Cool. I want it. I really want it. How much?]\n{d71.1} - [I don't know. A nickel?]\n{d72.1} - [Is this a yard sale?]\n{d73.1} - [I think this is a yard sale. Yard. Sale. People sell stuff they don't want anymore—so the stuff they don't want gets REUSED! OR sometimes they just give REUSEABLE things to a thrift store like Good Will. Like I said. Good for the earth.]\n{d74.1} - [What's Good Will?]\n{d75.1} - [No idea.]\n{d76.1} - [Stevie's coming! Stevie's coming! Stevie's coming!]\n{d77.1} - [Hi Pippi!]\n{d77.2} - [Get it, girl.]\n{d77.3} - [Mom's gonna like the presents I'm making her, but I'm still sad 'cause I really wanted to give her a pretty scarf.]\n{d78.1} - [Whatchya got there, Pippi?]\n{d79.1} - [Wow, Pippi. Where'd you get all this money?]\n{d80.1} - [You found buried treasure! Cool! I don't think this is enough for a scarf though. Shoot.]\n{d80.2} - [Oh, look! I can REUSE this paper on the clean side to make Mom a card. We really should REUSE this paper on both sides before we throw it out.]\n{d81.1} - [Okay, Cat. I need that scarf for Stevie.]\n{d82.1} - [What?! I paid hard earned money for that scarf.]\n{d83.1} - [You bought it with money you took from the Gift Horse's present fund.]\n{d84.1} - [Oh yeah. I forgot.]\n{d85.1} - [grrr. Cat.]\n{d86.1} - [What's that, Pippi? A present for me?]\n{d87.1} - [Hey, Pip, you REUSED newspaper like it was wrapping paper. Cool! Look, it's a scarf! A scarf I can give to my Mom! Thanks! Pippi! I'm going to wrap all these presents in newspaper right now.]\n{d88.1} - [And then after that, the kid should recycle the newspaper.]\n{d89.1} - [What? What's recycle?]\n{d90.1} - [It's when you put things in one of those things.]\n{d90.2} - [I watch a lot of T.V.]\n{d90.3} - [Too bad we can't read.]\n{d91.1} - [So, secret power: I can read these words!]\n{d91.2} - [Trash, recycle, organics.]\n{d91.3} - [Thank you! That was great! I'm gonna give Cat those words!]\n{d92.1} - [Meeow! I wish you wouldn't do that! Wait a minute! Wait! Wait! Wait! Hold the phone. I think I feel some words happening. Here we go!]\n{d92.2} - [Trash, Recycle. Organics. Who's the greatest now, dog? Cats or dogs, huh? Huh?]\n{d93.1} - [Well, Cat, I think we're BOTH great. I magically gave you those words.]\n{d94.1} - [Oh, you're so great, huh? Well, to prove how great cats are, I will now read again.]\n{d94.2} - [Hhmm... oh well.]\n{d95.1} - [Yep. But, we are both great. In our unique ways!]\n{d96.1} - [Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just don't do the irresistible puppy face, okay?]\n{d97.1} - [You mean this face?]\n{d98.1} - [Stop it. Stop that. Oh, look--there's nothing in the recycle bin. Nothing in the organics bin either.]\n{d99.1} - [Cat, you wanna help me fix this? We can sort the trash!]\n{d100.1} - [But, my nails....]\n{d101.1} - [Please...Cat. We could...work together....]\n{d102.1} - [Really? Cat and dog? Together? Sorting the trash?]\n{d103.1} - [Yes! Reducing, reusing, recycling! C'mon.]\n{d104.1} - [I must say, you're very energetic, aren't you?]\n{d105.1} - [Get the newspaper and put it in the recycle bin.]\n{d106.1} - [And, a tiny bit bossy…]\n{d107.1} - [Sorry. I'll get the glass.]\n{d107.2} - [Let's get the plastic. Some for you.]\n{d108.1} - [And, some for you!]\n{d109.1} - [Good job, Cat.]\n{d110.1} - [Uh--well-uh--good job, dog.]\n{d111.1} - [Wait! what about...the banana peel and the apple core?!]\n{d112.1} - [Hm...well...they used to be living things...so----]\n{d113.1} - [So...]\n{d114.1} - [Organics recycling!]\n{d115.1} - [What's all this?]\n{d116.1} - [The Mom likes fancy coffee from coffee shops.]\n{d117.1} - [Too bad! THIS DOES NOT REDUCE! THIS is more using, not less! All those cups in the trash. Something should be done about that. Bad for the earth. Too many cups in the trash—all headed for the landfill.]\n{d118.1} - [Wait! What's a landfill? Arfff! Huh…gone.]\n{d119.1} - [Okay. Let's see I have]\n{d119.2} - [1, 2, 3, presents. Wait, I thought I had 4]\n{d119.3} - [Shoot. I need another present and I have no idea what to get.]\n{d120.1} - [If you can think of something Stevie could get her Mom, maybe something so her mom won't have to use so many of these cups, raise your hand and I'll call on someone. (pulls from audience: coffee travel mug). A travel mug is a great idea! Cat will like this idea, too because there won't be any more coffee cups in the trash going to the landfill—whatever that is. Let's give Stevie that idea.]\n{d121.1} - [Wait! I've got it! I could buy Mom a travel mug for her coffee. I'll bet I have just enough money to do that. AND then all of these cups wouldn't have to go to the landfill.]\n{d122.1} - [Arffff, Warfff????]\n{d123.1} - [You know—the landfill—They're not good for the earth. That's why we should reduce, reuse and recycle our trash.]\n{d124.1} - [GRRRRgggghhhh!?]\n{d125.1} - [Yeah, I know. Mom and I aren't very good about doing the 3Rs. Mom's so busy and I forget all the time. But, when we found presents for Mom in the trash and we reused all that stuff, it was fun. WE REDUCED the Waste! I could do that more.]\n{d126.1} - [And, when I give Mom her travel mug, I could remind her about reducing trash 'cause of the landfills.]\n{d127.1} - [Rrrawwff.]\n{d128.1} - [You know…the landfills. BIG BIG piles of trash just lying there waiting to get buried. Waiting to rot. Stinking up the planet. Heating things up.]\n{d129.1} - [rrrrrrrawf.]\n{d130.1} - [I guess I could do the recycling. It's really not that hard. You just rinse stuff out a little and put them in the right bin. Wait!!! That could be another present! I could tell Mom that I'll do the recycling. That's a good present for Mom and for the earth!! Pip, I've got to go write that stuff down and then I'll wrap that piece of paper like a gift! (As he runs into the house)]\n{d131.1} - [Hmm…Landfill huh? Like this?]\n{d132.1} - [Oh no! Pippi, what did you do? Mom's going to be really mad at you.]\n{d133.1} - [I thought you learned your lesson when you dug up Mom's tomato plants.]\n{d134.1} - [Wait a minute. Wait. Pippi, you are such a smart puppy. You were making a landfill, weren't you?!?]\n{d135.1} - [Good dog. Uh-oh I got dirt on my pants and Gramma's coming over.]\n{d136.1} - [Cat! I learned about landfill.]\n{d136.2} - [What's inside the bag?]\n{d137.1} - [Oh, I returned the sweater I bought]\n{d137.2} - [since I no longer have the scarf that goes with it …and picked up a few things for your kid person.]\n{d138.1} - [Stevie.]\n{d139.1} - [Yeah, whatever.]\n{d140.1} - [You bought Stevie presents?! Really? Let's see! Take them out! Take them out! Rrafff!!]\n{d141.1} - [AND! Voila! The Cat's outa the bag!]\n{d142.1} - [This is very nice of you, Cat. I'm starting to like you a little, even if you are a cat.]\n{d143.1} - [Lovely. And I, CATegorically find you um---appealing]\n{d144.1} - [And...? And? And?]\n{d145.1} - [Okay. I guess I like you, too. You are likeable. For a dog.]\n{d146.1} - [Well, I'll be DOGgoned.]\n{d147.1} - [Ooh. Speaking of gone. I'm out. See ya. Ciao]\n{d148.1} - [Hey! Hey! Hey! come back here! Cats. No loyalty.]\n{d149.1} - [What is it Pip?]\n{d150.1} - [For me?! Wow! You must have found more buried treasure in the yard, huh, Pip. Cool! Hhmm… I feel good about having this toy]\n{d150.2} - [but not so good about this one.]\n{d151.1} - [Well, this one has way too much packaging and it's just going to end up in the landfill.
