Sarah Good, a local homeless woman who was known for wandering door to door with her four year old daughter Dorothy begging for food or shelter, was often seen muttering under her breath when leaving, regardless of the outcome, which led many to believe she was casting spells. During her examination, she claimed innocence, and when the girls in the crowd began to act tormented, she blamed her co-accused Sarah Osborne. Osborne, on the other hand, maintained that she had nothing to do with witchcraft and was confused as to why anyone would claim otherwise. However, one family in Salem Village would disagree with that notion. A few years prior when her husband passed away, he left the land to their two sons. But when she eventually remarried, she kept the land for herself, which greatly angered her late husband's relatives... the Putnam family. But the one who stood out the most out of the trio, was Samuel Parris' slave Tituba. She was liked within the minister's household, and unlike the Sarahs who were named alongside her, the community in general knew very little about her. Although before very long, that would all change. When Tituba was examined in front of a crowd nearly the size of the village itself, she not only admitted to hurting the girls and being a witch, but she swore that both Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, as well as a few others whose names she did not know, were all tormenting the girls"

And soon, news would reach me at my home that another name provided by the Putnam clan was none other than my own, Rebecca Nurse. The most absurd part of it all, is that no one even knows who it was who first mentioned my name. Ann Putnam Jr and Mercy Lewis both claimed that it was Ann's mother who told them to accuse me. Whereas Ann Sr told everyone that her daughter had provided my name. Despite the confusion about how I was initially accused, more would join in and claim that I was afflicting them. I never stood a chance."

To perhaps nobody's surprise but his own, the afflicted girls soon went on to then accuse him of being a witch. Wanting to avoid the ordeal, Willard decided to go on the run. But the idea of a witch on the loose heightened an already tense community, and even with him gone, the girls found ways to cause him trouble. When Willard's cousin-in-law Daniel Wilkins became suddenly sick, the girls seized the opportunity to blame him for that as well. Mercy Lewis claimed to see Willard's apparition hovering over and afflicting him. She then made the bold prediction that if Willard was not apprehended within the next two days, that Wilkins would die from his afflictions. Unfortunately, for both Wilkins and Willard, Mercy's bluff proved to be true and two days later, Wilkins passed away. A new warrant was released for Willard's arrest, and two days later they discovered him hiding out halfway across the colony, tending to one of his properties. He was immediately examined and sent to prison for the murder of Daniel Wilkins."

After seeing how his wife had been treated during her trial, Giles had no interest in participating in what he had come to believe was a mockery of justice. So when the judges proceeded to ask if he would accept the terms of the trial, Giles refused to respond. The court was at a loss. Their own tradition stated that without his consent, they could not proceed with a trial. However, Thomas Putnam stepped up and reminded the court of an old English law which outlined a method for dealing with such a situation. The technique included laying an individual down on the ground before placing a wooden plank across the length of their body. Then they would add one stone after another, stopping only to ask the victim if they were willing to give their consent. Giles Corey, at the age of 81, withstood this torture for hours. When asked once more if he was willing to stand trial, he had two words for Sheriff Corwin: More Weight."
