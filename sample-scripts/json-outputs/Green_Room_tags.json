Them. I dunno, the people who give advice on auditioning. Once they learn you wrote the piece, they don't only judge you on your acting, but also your writing. But if you use a pseudonym, then they only focus on your acting, which is what I want Ms. Daniels to focus on.]\n{d54.1} - [Well, I still think that's pretty amazing.]\n{d54.2} - [Can we hear it?]\n{d55.1} - [You mean, like now?]\n{d56.1} - [Yeah?]\n{d57.1} - [Uhh...]\n{d58.1} - [Please? If anyone joins, you can stop, I just want to see how it starts.]\n{d59.1} - [Okay.]\n{d59.2} - [My voice could be as loud as a symphony if I wanted to be. But if it can then why isn't it? Simple, I'm scared. I'm scared of the fact that it might be too loud and it might draw attention to me. But what's so wrong with attention? Because Then I'm forced to be myself instead of what society wants me to be. But isn't that a good thing? Standing up to society? Sure, if you have the backbone to take the criticism which unfortunately I do not have. So instead I am a record player. Waiting for someone to put my record on so I can repeat what society has brainwashed me to think. I am nothing more than a girl with no personality because I care about what others think to the point where I am no longer myself]\n{d60.1} - [How are we supposed to compete against that? I felt actual goosebumps]\n{d61.1} - [Right? I'm just hoping that Ms. Daniels casts me as a comic relief or something because I trip over the door on my way into audition.]\n{d62.1} - [We're auditioning virtually. What door are you tripping over?]\n{d63.1} - [You see, that's why it is so funny.]\n{d63.2} - [Isn't it your turn now, Cassie?]\n{d64.1} - [Me? I haven't done it in front of anyone else yet...]\n{d65.1} - [Are you hoping for Ms. Daniels to leave the room when it's your turn?]\n{d66.1} - [No.]\n{d67.1} - [Well then you better get over that part quick.]\n{d68.1} - [You're going to do great. Let's hear it.]\n{d69.1} - [Heeeeeeeey.]\n{d70.1} - [Saved by the Bail.]\n{d71.1} - [What did I miss?]\n{d72.1} - [Cassie was just about to show us her monologue.]\n{d73.1} - [Oh. Sorry.]\n{d73.2} - [Continue, I suppose?]\n{d74.1} - [No, no, it's dumb. People are logging in, and we'r-]\n{d75.1} - [Cool. Well I just wanted to wish you all luck before I totally blow you out of contention for whatever role it is that you were hoping to get.]\n{d76.1} - [Oh is that so?]\n{d77.1} - [Yup.]\n{d78.1} - [And which role is that?]\n{d79.1} - [I dunno. Any of them.]\n{d79.2} - [What play are we even doing? Has Ms. Daniels made an announcement yet?]\n{d80.1} - [No. Not yet.]\n{d81.1} - [That's weird, right? Even for Ms. Daniels?]\n{d82.1} - [Not really. My cousin, from New York, told me she almost never knows which show she is auditioning for.]\n{d83.1} - [Whatever. I was hoping to find a piece that highlights me as an actor in the role that I want.]\n{d84.1} - [Which, again, to clarify, is all of them.]\n{d85.1} - [Yes. Now shut up, or I won't let you be my understudy.]\n{d86.1} - [I guess that's valid.]\n{d87.1} - [No it isn't, I would be a fantastic understudy.]\n{d88.1} - [Kelly, listen to Bailey and shut up.]\n{d88.2} - [What did you end up choosing?]\n{d89.1} - [Do you want to hear it?]\n{d90.1} - [Yeah.]\n{d91.1} - [Sure!]\n{d92.1} - [I think she was just asking to be polite, but yeah, sure, why not.]\n{d93.1} - [Did you know that before I met you, I used to get up every single morning and spend an hour working on my routine before taking a shower and heading to class? Every. Single. Morning. Then we met, and now I haven't even stepped into the studio in months. So when you stand there and say that I'm not the same person you fell in love with, I can't even get upset or defensive about it, because you are right. I am not the same person from last fall. I've given up the things that actually matter to me just so I could spend more time with you. I've slowly chipped away at all the things that make me \"me\", and now I'm left hollow. A fraction of the person I used to be.]\n{d93.2} - [But you did get one thing wrong in your little speech. You ending things isn't going to leave me with \"nothing\". It was being with you that did that to me. But now I think it's time I start to get it all back.]\n{d94.1} - [Yeah, I'm definitely not getting cast.]\n{d95.1} - [Yes you are. I've seen you act. You're a shoe-in.]\n{d96.1} - [I dunno, I'm not feeling too great about it all right now. I should have chosen a different monologue instead of cutting it all up like I did.]\n{d97.1} - [Show us. Maybe we can help.]\n{d98.1} - [I'm just starting to get into my head about it.]\n{d99.1} - [I found it helpful, actually. I mean, I've practiced it dozens of times, but it's a little different with faces staring back at you on your computer screen.]\n{d100.1} - [Yeah. I didn't realize how distracting it would be! Seeing your reactions almost threw me off.]\n{d101.1} - [Wait, were you all planning on looking at the camera when you auditioned?]\n{d102.1} - [Yeah...?]\n{d103.1} - [That's like looking right at the director when you audition in person?]\n{d104.1} - [No... You look right at the director when you audition?]\n{d105.1} - [Where else are we supposed to look?]\n{d106.1} - [Literally anywhere else.]\n{d107.1} - [But what if your piece is talking directly at someone?]\n{d108.1} - [Then imagine a different person out in the audience, or just off screen. You want the director to be an observer, not a part of your scene. If you look directly at them, it makes them feel like they need to participate, or worse, it shuts them down entirely.]\n{d109.1} - [But, doesn't that look weird? You just staring off into the distance saying your lines?]\n{d110.1} - [Don't \"stare\", just pick a point, and put your person there, and then behave like a normal human being. Do you awkwardly stare at every single person you communicate with in the real world?]\n{d110.2} - [I mean, I do, but not when I audition. That's just weird.]\n{d111.1} - [No one has ever accused you of being a normal human being.]\n{d112.1} - [I'd fight them if they did.]\n{d113.1} - [Show us.]\n{d114.1} - [Alright.]\n{d114.2} - [Are you. Kidding. Me? No, stop laughing. This isn't at all funny. Do you have any idea what you have done?]\n{d114.3} - [In one afternoon, you have managed to ruin over six years of a meticulously agonizing effort to curate what can only be described as perfection.]\n{d114.4} - [I can't believe you would do this to me. I trusted you. Despite what all of my friends said and even against my own better judgment, I let you in because you looked me in the eye and told me that you would never betray me. You promised that you would absolutely, never mess with my Netflix queue. And now look. I said look!\"The Do-Over\"? Do I look like a forty-year old lonely bro living in his mother's basement? No? Then why on earth is Netflix advertising an Adam Sandler movie to me?]\n{d115.1} - [Maybe I will take you as an understudy after all.]\n{d116.1} - [Thank you. I accept.]\n{d117.1} - [Ehh, I said maybe.]\n{d118.1} - [That actually was a lot less uncomfortable than I had expected.]\n{d119.1} - [Gee, thanks?]\n{d120.1} - [No, sorry. Your monologue was great. I meant the looking at a different spot.]\n{d121.1} - [Yeeeah. I am going to have to revisit my entire monologue now.]\n{d122.1} - [Definitely don't do that. You never make changes right before you audition. Surefire way to trip yourself up.]\n{d123.1} - [But, like, what if you really need to make some changes.]\n{d124.1} - [Trust me. Take the note, tuck it away, and think about it after you audition.]\n{d125.1} - [You know, I think I might head out. I-]\n{d126.1} - [Where is everyone?]\n{d127.1} - [Who is missing? Isn't it just the seniors today?]\n{d128.1} - [Yeah, but we're still missing three more.]\n{d129.1} - [Who else is signed up?]\n{d130.1} - [Jake.]\n{d131.1} - [Ugh.]\n{d132.1} - [Stu.]\n{d133.1} - [Ugh.]\n{d134.1} - [Who is Stu?]\n{d135.1} - [I dunno, but another guy so he is probably already cast.]\n{d136.1} - [And Grace.]\n{d137.1} - [Grace? Wait who is Grace?]\n{d138.1} - [I literally have just a list of names, other than that, I know nothing.]\n{d139.1} - [What about Sarah?]\n{d140.1} - [Not on the list.]\n{d141.1} - [I was really hoping she signed up.]\n{d142.1} - [She's not on the list, and she's not here, so it's not my problem]\n{d143.1} - [What the heck? What's her problem?]\n{d144.1} - [Well, I heard that she was planning on auditioning this year, but Ms. Daniels wouldn't let her.]\n{d145.1} - [Why not?]\n{d146.1} - [She didn't have anyone else to stage manage the show, so she pressured her into staying on as stage manager.]\n{d147.1} - [That's awful. No wonder she was so weird before.]\n{d148.1} - [I still think she hates us.]\n{d149.1} - [She doesn't hate us, she just-]\n{d150.1} - [Hi, you-]\n{d151.1} - [Hey Stewie! Congratulations on being cast!]\n{d152.1} - [Uh.. did I miss-]\n{d153.1} - [Ignore her. She's just commenting on the fact that you're a guy and that means you'll probably get cast.]\n{d154.1} - [Oh.]\n{d155.1} - [Not that you wouldn't be cast if you were a girl, it's just that we don't have a lot of guys in the program, and-]\n{d156.1} - [Smooth.]\n{d157.1} - [So are you new here, or...]\n{d158.1} - [Um, no, it's-]\n{d158.2} - [Yeah, I guess I am.]\n{d159.1} - [Hey, is this the waiting room for spring play auditions?]\n{d160.1} - [Yup.]\n{d161.1} - [Hey, I'm Grace.]\n{d162.1} - [Welcome, Grace. I'm Anna.]\n{d163.1} - [Cassie.]\n{d164.1} - [Oh, uh, my name is Stu. Nice to meet you.]\n{d165.1} - [Bailey, but you can call me Bails.]\n{d166.1} - [Literally no one has ever called her that and if you do, I promise I will make fun of you for the rest of your time at this school]\n{d167.1} - [And that's Kelly. Don't worry about anything she says. She'll probably forget even meeting you, let alone follow through on any fake threats. Isn't that right, Kelly?]\n{d168.1} - [I already stopped paying attention to what you were saying.]\n{d169.1} - [Anyway... Grace, did you do theatre at your old school, or just trying something new?]\n{d170.1} - [Oh, yeah, I've done theatre most of my life.]\n{d171.1} - [Oh.]\n{d172.1} - [No, I mean, not like professionally or anything like that. You know, just the shows at my high school. Well and middle school stuff. Well, and a few summers ago I worked on a regional production of Annie.]\n{d173.1} - [I love Annie! What role did you play?]\n{d174.1} - [Um,]\n{d174.2} - [Annie?]\n{d175.1} - [Greeeaaat.]\n{d176.1} - [Has anyone seen Jake?]\n{d177.1} - [Hello, students! Emma, is everyone here?]\n{d178.1} - [Everyone except Jake. He hasn't showed up yet, and he isn't answering his phone.]\n{d179.1} - [Oh Jacob sent me a video audition. It was delightful. Okay, so I know a few of you seemed to take your cue from the White Rabbit and were running late, but if you could all remain here in this room until you've been called in to audition, that would really help move this whole thing along.]\n{d179.2} - [Now, I know you're all probably dying to know which play we are doing this spring, so let me share a little insider information with you all.]\n{d179.3} - [As I am sure that everyone here is well aware, we happen to have a larger than usual outgoing class this year, and it was with that in mind that I wanted everyone to have a grand finale of sorts, and I thought, what better show to highlight the concept of growing up and moving on than Peter and the Starcatcher?]\n{d179.4} - [Unfortunately, I was unable to get the streaming rights, so we had to let that one go.]\n{d179.5} - [But, not one to be easily dismayed, I ventured on, determined to find the perfect play for my students. And that is when I came across a little play called Clue.]\n{d179.6} - [And did you know that six other schools are doing the exact same show all within an hour drive? So I said, No, Thank You! to that.]\n{d179.7} - [But fear not, because I sent out a few more requests for rights, one of which sounds promising, and I am very excited about it, but I don't want to jinx it just yet, so I'm not going to tell you what it is. (beat) But I will say that this 2016 Tony Award winning gem focuses on the fight for the American Dream when a certain immigrant moves to New York City hoping for a better life? That story ringing a little bell for any of my little thespians?]\n{d180.1} - [Now, don't let that excitement throw you all off from your auditions. I have very high expectations for each of you seniors, that's why you all get to audition a day before everyone else this year. That and I am not entirely sure how to make my screen show more than ten of you at a time, but mainly the first thing.]\n{d180.2} - [I'm just going to get prepared in the audition room and we'll start momentarily. Good luck everyone. I can't wait to see what you got for me this year!]\n{d181.1} - [I'm surprised she even had Jake submit an audition.]\n{d182.1} - [What do you mean?]\n{d183.1} - [It's sorta a running joke that Jake always gets the role he wants each year.]\n{d184.1} - [Is it a joke though if it's accurate?]\n{d185.1} - [Or not funny?]\n{d186.1} - [Not a lot of guys here I take it?]\n{d187.1} - [More like no guys. I heard for the three years before we got here, not a single guy auditioned for a show.]\n{d188.1} - [Which is probably why Ms. Daniels keeps casting Jake in everything while she has him.]\n{d189.1} - [Or she could just choose better plays. Maybe something written since the invention of the internet?]\n{d190.1} - [Or the typewriter?]\n{d191.1} - [Even I have to admit that for a program with only one guy, we've done a few shows that were definitely male heavy.]\n{d192.1} - [Only one guy?]\n{d192.2} - [What about Stu.]\n{d193.1} - [Oh, well, yeah. And now we have Stu.]\n{d194.1} - [But Stu is new this year, like you.]\n{d195.1} - [So up until this point.]\n{d196.1} - [Um, guys...]\n{d197.1} - [Wouldn't it be great if Stu got the lead, though?]\n{d198.1} - [I'd vote for him.]\n{d199.1} - [Hey, guys...]\n{d200.1} - [You don't vote for roles.]\n{d201.1} - [Maybe you don't.]\n{d202.1} - [What does that even mean?]\n{d203.1} - [Guys!]\n{d203.2} - [Can we talk about something else? (beat) Please?]\n{d204.1} - [Um, sure.]\n{d204.2} - [So what do you all think Ms. Daniels was hinting at?]\n{d205.1} - [I mean, it obviously sounded like she was talking about Hamilton, right?]\n{d206.1} - [“2016 Tony winning story about a couple of immigrants and the American Dream?”]\n{d207.1} - [My vote is on her going senile.]\n{d208.1} - [I vote you shut up!]\n{d209.1} - [Ooookay.]\n{d209.2} - [So, Stu, my fellow newbie, did you do theatre at your old school too?]\n{d210.1} - [Yeah, where did you go before here?]\n{d211.1} - [Um, I've actually always gone here. I'm not new.]\n{d212.1} - [Oh, you're just new to theatre?]\n{d212.2} - [Oh my god, is this your first audition?]\n{d213.1} - [Wait, are you a senior? I thought today was only for seniors?]\n{d214.1} - [No, I've done theatre before. It's just-]\n{d215.1} - [Oh, have you done shows over at St. Mikes?]\n{d216.1} - [Do we call those shows?]\n{d217.1} - [Kelly, go back to shutting up, please?]\n{d218.1} - [No. I've mainly done-]\n{d219.1} - [Okay, Cassie, you're up.]\n{d220.1} - [No, not yet. Can't someone else go?]\n{d221.1} - [I'll go.]\n{d222.1} - [Cassie, now or never. No skipping.]\n{d223.1} - [You've got this, Cassie.]\n{d224.1} - [Yeah. Just remember everything we've talked about. But also don't change a thing.]\n{d225.1} - [Hey, Cassie. It's Cassie, right? Take a deep breath, okay?]\n{d226.1} - [Okay.]\n{d227.1} - [Now go in there and forget about everything else, and just show Ms. Daniels what you've got to offer. That's all she really wants to see.]\n{d228.1} - [I don't think I've ever seen her so nervous before.]\n{d229.1} - [Yeah. Maybe she should have submitted a video like Jake.]\n{d230.1} - [How much you wanna bet he sent in his Jaws monologue.]\n{d231.1} - [He did a monologue from a movie?]\n{d232.1} - [Yeah. He's done the same one every year.]\n{d233.1} - [What's wrong with doing a monologue from a movie?]\n{d234.1} - [Nothing is exactly wrong with it, but you're sorta shooting yourself in the foot. When you do a monologue from a movie, there is a \"right\" way to do it. The actor in the film originated the role and any attempt to recreate that will just look like a cheap knockoff.]\n{d235.1} - [Well I'm glad I didn't go that route this year.]\n{d236.1} - [Which monologue did you choose, Grace?]\n{d237.1} - [You don't need to-]\n{d238.1} - [Ope, it's happening.]\n{d239.1} - [Do you remember when we were little, and every night when we went to bed, Dad would stop in when he got home from work and if we were still up, he would sing us that song? The one telling us to dream? I loved hearing it.]\n{d239.2} - [For the longest time I thought he made it up. That it was his little ditty just for us. It wasn't until I heard it on the radio late one night driving home from school that I realized it was just some old song. I remember pulling off to the side of the road and started to sing along. I hadn't even thought of the song in years, but every word came right back to me. Every single word.]\n{d239.3} - [The next morning is when I got the call from the hospital. It was like he was saying goodnight to me, one last time, you know? Over the radio.]\n{d240.1} - [I am glad Cassie didn't see that. You would have sent the poor girl into convulsions.]\n{d241.1} - [Thank you?]\n{d242.1} - [You see how she didn't stare into the camera either?]\n{d243.1} - [You should never do that.]\n{d244.1} - [I know.]\n{d245.1} - [That's awkward.]\n{d246.1} - [Right?]\n{d247.1} - [Okay, okay. I'll change it.]\n{d248.1} - [No!]\n{d249.1} - [No! Whatever you do, don't change anything this close to your audition. Not unless you want to ruin everything.]\n{d250.1} - [How bad could changing just a few small things really be?]\n{d251.1} - [Kelly. You're up.]\n{d252.1} - [Hey, Cassie! How'd it go?]\n{d253.1} - [Oh no, what happened?]\n{d254.1} - [I-I.. I made some changes last minute.]\n{d255.1} - [Oh no, you poor thing. What happened?]\n{d256.1} - [I honestly can't even really remember. It was like I entered a fugue state and the next thing I remember, Ms. Daniels was calling my name and saying that I just trailed off mid-monologue.]\n{d257.1} - [Oh, Cass, I'm so sorry. It looked so good the other day!]\n{d258.1} - [The other day? I didn't know the two of you were already friends?]\n{d259.1} - [I'll be right back.]\n{d260.1} - [So I guess I am the only one here who doesn't know anyone.]\n{d261.1} - [I didn't know Stu knew anyone. Who else do you know?]\n{d262.1} - [Are you kidding me?]\n{d263.1} - [No?]\n{d264.1} - [Wow. I'd almost take this as a compliment if it didn't hurt so much.]\n{d265.1} - [What's going on?]\n{d266.1} - [Stu.]\n{d267.1} - [That was a little intense right?]\n{d268.1} - [Noooo! What did I miss?]\n{d269.1} - [I... don't really know.]\n{d270.1} - [Stu mentioned that he had helped Cassie on her monologue, and then he got mad at Anna for asking who else he knew.]\n{d271.1} - [Oh. Weird.]\n{d272.1} - [It really was. Are you all sure you've never met him before?]\n{d273.1} - [I can't anymore.]\n{d274.1} - [Can't what?]\n{d275.1} - [I told him I wouldn't say anything, but you are all being so mean right now, pretending you don't know who he is, and I can't stand it.]\n{d276.1} - [I'm confused. Do you all know Stu, or not?]\n{d277.1} - [No!]\n{d278.1} - [No!]\n{d279.1} - [No!]\n{d280.1} - [Yes!]\n{d281.1} - [Sarah?!]\n{d282.1} - [What about-]\n{d283.1} - [Oh, my God. How did I not...]\n{d284.1} - [Well, I feel like a complete--]\n{d285.1} - [Wait, are you saying- Oohhhh.]\n{d286.1} - [Someone want to tell me what is going on? Or maybe finish a sentence?]\n{d287.1} - [Stu hasn't always gone by Stu.]\n{d288.1} - [Ok?]\n{d289.1} - [We used to know Stu by a different name.]\n{d290.1} - [I went by Gracelyn until I was ten, what's the big deal?]\n{d291.1} - [Like... a completely different name.]\n{d292.1} - [Before he transitioned.]\n{d293.1} - [Ohhhhh! Okay. I follow.]\n{d293.2} - [So?]\n{d294.1} - [I had no idea that Sarah-]\n{d295.1} - [Stu. His name is Stu.]\n{d296.1} - [Oh, sorry. Stu. I just no had no idea that Stu-]\n{d297.1} - [Okay, so we're almost done. Bailey it's your turn. After Bailey will be Grace, and then Anna. If you could all stick around, Ms. Daniels wants to have a chat with you all when we're done.]\n{d298.1} - [Bailey, did you hear me?]\n{d299.1} - [BAILEY!]\n{d300.1} - [Oh. Wait, what? is it my turn?]\n{d301.1} - [You are all useless. This show would literally fall apart if any of you were in charge.]\n{d302.1} - [Well, she's a delight.]\n{d303.1} - [She really isn't]\n{d304.1} - [She is just having a rough day. Supposedly she wanted to audition, but Ms. Daniels wouldn't let her.]\n{d305.1} - [Why?]\n{d306.1} - [She's the only one nagging enough to do a halfway decent job at Stage Managing.]\n{d307.1} - [It really is a thankless job.]\n{d308.1} - [That's why I refuse to thank her.]\n{d309.1} - [Hey, Stu. How did your audition go?]\n{d310.1} - [I'd like to think it went well, but apparently I'm pretty forgettable.]\n{d311.1} - [Look, Stu, I'm... We're-]\n{d312.1} - [I told them. I'm sorry. I know you asked me not to, but I did.]\n{d313.1} - [It's okay, Cass. The point is that you shouldn't have had to.]\n{d314.1} - [I know you're upset, and you have every right to be, but-]\n{d315.1} - [Upset? No, I'm not upset. I'd be upset if you all turned out to be transphobic pieces of garbage, but-]\n{d316.1} - [No, we're not. I swear.]\n{d317.1} - [Totally. I hope you know that we 100% support you!]\n{d318.1} - [Then why didn't you?]\n{d319.1} - [Why didn't we what?]\n{d320.1} - [Support me.]\n{d321.1} - [I didn't... We didn't know that-]\n{d322.1} - [Of course you didn't. But did either of you ever call to ask? Send an email, a text, anything?]\n{d323.1} - [It's been a really weird year.]\n{d324.1} - [Yeah, I know. Tell me about it.]\n{d325.1} - [I just mean, it wasn't anything personal. I've barely kept in touch with anyone from that show aside from Kelly.]\n{d326.1} - [It's been rough.]\n{d327.1} - [Not. Now.]\n{d328.1} - [Sorry.]\n{d329.1} - [Stu, if we knew, we'd have reached out in a heartbeat. But you also didn't reach out to us.]\n{d330.1} - [You knew I had stuff going on when I didn't audition last year.]\n{d331.1} - [I didn't know it was this!]\n{d332.1} - [What does it matter? If we were such good friends, it shouldn't matter what I was going through, just that I was going through something.]\n{d333.1} - [Stu...]\n{d334.1} - [I just thought, I dunno, that maybe I'd show up today, at the absolute very least you'd be excited to see me.]\n{d335.1} - [I was. I mean, I am!]\n{d336.1} - [You didn't even recognize me.]\n{d337.1} - [And that is how you do it, people!]\n{d338.1} - [Normally people wait until the director tells them to before leaving.]\n{d339.1} - [Not me. Virtual mic drop.]\n{d340.1} - [Sup, Stu. Sorry about before, but glad to have you back.]\n{d341.1} - [I feel like I'm missing something.]\n{d342.1} - [Don't ask.]\n{d343.1} - [Wasn't going to. Grace, your turn.]\n{d344.1} - [This has all been... very interesting... but I am going to leave now.]\n{d345.1} - [What'd I miss?]\n{d346.1} - [Anna and Kelly explaining to Stu why they didn't recognize him.]\n{d347.1} - [That whole time? Dudes, get over yourselves. It's not about you. Acknowledge your screw up, apologize, do better, and move on.]\n{d348.1} - [We said we're sorry!]\n{d349.1} - [You didn't though.]\n{d350.1} - [Yes we did.]\n{d351.1} - [No you didn't. You explained that you were not transphobic, why you hadn't reached out to me, and even told me how I should have reached out to you and let you know, but neither of you said you're sorry even once.]\n{d352.1} - [I'm so sorry, Stu.]\n{d353.1} - [Me too. I'm sorry.]\n{d354.1} - [Thank you.]\n{d355.1} - [Was that so hard?]\n{d355.2} - [I think I speak for all of us when I say that we missed having you around.]\n{d356.1} - [Great. Now that that's settled, can we all talk about how much we hope this Grace character totally biffs her audition?]\n{d356.2} - [Come on, I can't be the only one thinking it.]\n{d357.1} - [I think you are.]\n{d358.1} - [Why? If she does bad, you have a better chance at getting a solid role.]\n{d359.1} - [That... is probably the most self centered, and insecure thing I've ever heard you say, and that's saying something.]\n{d360.1} - [Hey-]\n{d361.1} - [No, I mean it. You want her to do bad so that you can succeed? You come back in here from your audition acting like you just nailed the lead role without even trying, and then you turn around and dump all over someone else who has been nothing but nice and welcoming to each and every one of us. And for what? So you can feel better about your work? If I am going to be in any play, I hope more than anything else that it ends up being the best possible play that we can make, and that requires everyone to always be putting their best foot forward. Not casting second best options because the first had an unlucky few moments. I went in there, wanting more than anything else a chance to show just what I can do, and although I didn't give my best performance, not once this entire day have I hoped for any of you to do less than spectacular. But apparently that is how we see things differently. I want to do better so I can be my best self. You just want yourself to be the best.]\n{d362.1} - [Woah.]\n{d363.1} - [Yeah, Cass!]\n{d364.1} - [I almost wish we could have recorded that. I think that was your best work yet!]\n{d365.1} - [I'm sorry. I didn't think about what I said. I don't really hope she bombs.]\n{d366.1} - [Anna, it's your turn whenever you are ready.]\n{d367.1} - [What in all that is holy was that?]\n{d368.1} - [Was she smiling?]\n{d369.1} - [It sure looked like it.]\n{d370.1} - [No, I saw something about this on Animal Planet. Right before a predator goes in for the kill, they show their teeth.]\n{d371.1} - [No, no. I just told Ms. Daniels, that I could stage managing if Emma wanted to audition.]\n{d372.1} - [Wow, that was... really nice of you.]\n{d373.1} - [Well, she still has to audition, so who knows, but I don't mind helping out behind the scenes. It's important to know how things work in all areas of theatre, you know?]\n{d374.1} - [If you say so. More roles for me.]\n{d375.1} - [More than all of them?]\n{d376.1} - [So Stu, How'd it go when you were in there?]\n{d377.1} - [It went pretty well, I think.]\n{d378.1} - [What did you end up doing? We never got to see it.]\n{d379.1} - [It was nothing. Just something I've been working on for a little bit.]\n{d380.1} - [Oh, an original, eh?]\n{d381.1} - [Sorta.]\n{d382.1} - [You should do it now. Show us!]\n{d383.1} - [Yeah, come on! You never let me see it!]\n{d384.1} - [Stu-u, Stu-u, Stu-u.]\n{d385.1} - [Fine, fine. I'll do it.]\n{d385.2} - [On the outside, things may seem normal to you. You pass by without second guessing. You see a good friend, someone who you've known for awhile. Or at least thought you did. But there's something deeper going on. Something not everyone will understand. Beyond all the smiles and laughs, there's someone trembling inside. Someone you've never met before, but they know you. They're scared to show themselves, the body around them being a shelter. But that shelter is crumbling slowly. It wants to break free, but they're scared. Scared that people will glare and judge. People that were once considered their friends. Just like you. Hopefully one day you'll meet them soon. All they want is for you to see them for who they are. Day after day they creep out more and more. That shelter one day will break. Who knows how you and others will react. But they know this is the real them, no matter what is said.]\n{d386.1} - [If that is what you showed Ms. Daniels, then Jake might be in trouble after all.]\n{d387.1} - [Yeah?]\n{d388.1} - [If she doesn't give you his part, then she's blind.]\n{d389.1} - [You don't even know what part is his part.]\n{d390.1} - [The lead, obviously.]\n{d391.1} - [I hate that it really is obvious.]\n{d392.1} - [You know, I'm not sure I'd want a role like that. Most of the time the side characters are the most fun to play.]\n{d393.1} - [They really are! Once, I got to-]\n{d394.1} - [Yeah, we get it. You've been in a lot plays, and you're an all around amazing person, so just let it go and be my best friend already, so I can learn all your tricks and ultimately destroy you.]\n{d395.1} - [Um... okay?]\n{d396.1} - [How'd it go?]\n{d397.1} - [Congratulations everyone on a wonderful round of auditions! Now, normally I would have let you all go after your audition, but I have some news that I didn't want you to hear from anywhere else.]\n{d398.1} - [Is it about the play?]\n{d399.1} - [It sure is! I checked my email a little bit ago, and... we got it! The rights are ours!]\n{d400.1} - [Are you serious? We got the rights to Hamilton?!]\n{d401.1} - [Wha- Hamilton? Lord no. No, no, no. Why on earth would you think we're doing Hamilton?]\n{d402.1} - [You said \"2016 Tony Award Winner\"?]\n{d403.1} - [Yes. The 2016 Tony Award winner for Best Revival of a Play for the Arthur Miller classic, A View from the Bridge!]\n{d404.1} - [I knew it was too good to be true.]\n{d405.1} - [On the contrary. A View from the Bridge is a gripping tale about an Italian American, Eddie Carbo-]\n{d405.2} - [Wait, where is everyone going?]\n{d406.1} - [It must be a connectivity thing, Ms. Daniels. I'm sure they are all very interested in the play. You should send it all out in an email so they don't miss out.]\n{d407.1} - [What a great idea, Anna. I'll do just that. (to GRACE) Grace, if you wouldn't mind joining me back in the audition room, I'd like to chat with you about a few things? Emma, are you sure you're ready to audition today?]\n{d408.1} - [I am! I'll be over in a couple minutes.]\n{d409.1} - [Sounds good. Grace?]\n{d410.1} - [It was great meeting you all! I hope we get to work together.]\n{d411.1} - [Same here!]\n{d412.1} - [Me too!]\n{d413.1} - [Hey, Stu!]\n{d414.1} - [Yeah?]\n{d415.1} - [A few of us were going to hop on Discord in a bit and play some Among Us. Care to join?]\n{d416.1} - [Are you asking if I'd like to hop into a room with all of you and try to figure out which of you is a backstabbing, devious, imposter who will lie directly to my face?]\n{d417.1} - [Pretty much, yeah.]\n{d418.1} - [Sounds sus. I'm definitely in. Send me an invite.]\n{d419.1} - [Will do. See you in a bit.]\n{d420.1} - [Perfect.]\n{d421.1} - [And Stu?]\n{d422.1} - [Mm?]\n{d423.1} - [It really is great to have you back.]\n{d424.1} - [All your friends called me a nobody. I would walk through life like a little kid trying to keep their balance along the curb of the sidewalk which is where I'm at right now balancing my normal life and the success of being a singer, which you thought I couldn't do. You told me there are people way better than me.]\n{d424.2} - [I know that. To this day even though I have the happiness and fame you thought I wouldn't I know there are others better than me, but I never let your cruel words get to me. You looked down on me and laughed at my dreams, but now I'm preparing to stand on a stage in front of thousands to share my story with my new single. I left you in the past when you started telling me I could never amount to it and I still have a great future, even without you. I have the strength it takes to go into something as scary as this all alone. I was a mirror to you and shattered me into a million shards, but you gave me the strength to show thousands of others like me that anything is possible as long as they believe in themselves. Thank you.]\n\nStage Directions\n{stgd3} - [(Anna trails off and begins blowing air through her lips. She rolls her neck and shoulders and gets ready.
