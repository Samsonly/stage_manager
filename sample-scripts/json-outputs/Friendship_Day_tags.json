That's not a holiday.]\n{d68.1} - [Yep. May 23rd. Me and my mom go to the Shellebration of turtles everywhere. It's a spotlight on turtles! It's a focus on the need to protect turtles, tortoises, and habitats, ‘cause we're losing our places to live– Did you know that all tortoises are turtles, but not all turtles are tortoises?]\n{d69.1} - [Fascinating– really fascinating!]\n{d70.1} - [“Fascinating, really fascinating.”]\n{d71.1} - [Um– what?]\n{d72.1} - [Um-nothing. Never mind.]\n{d73.1} - [This year's theme for World Turtle Day is “I Love Turtles.” A lot of kids don't know real turtles or tortoises. They only know Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. And that's okay because it's at least a start. I mean, they were just regular baby turtles, and somebody dropped them into a sewer, and—]\n{d74.1} - [Um? Excuse me–]\n{d75.1} - [—then they landed in some bad goo that changed them into Big Mutants, and they have four different personalities; Leonardo “Leo”– The Leader. Donatello “Donnie”– The Genius. Michelangelo “Mikey”– The Funny One. Raphael “Raph”– The Rebel. And Mikey is the youngest one, he's really funny and—]\n{d76.1} - [I did not know that tortoises could talk so fast.]\n{d77.1} - [Oh, we're not slow all the time. Anyways, the Ninja Turtles are what my mom calls “gateway turtles…” Like the gate to caring about real ones, like me.]\n{d78.1} - [Wow, there's so much to know about real tortoises… and of course the, um– imaginary? Ones?]\n{d79.1} - [Oh. Ninja Turtles are very real.]\n{d80.1} - [Don't get him going!]\n{d81.1} - [Too late. Hey, tortoise. Ask me a question.]\n{d82.1} - [I asked you a question. Now it's your turn to ask me a question. That's how friends talk.]\n{d83.1} - [Friends? Puh-lease!]\n{d84.1} - [We're friends?]\n{d85.1} - [We're not. But we could be. All three of us.]\n{d86.1} - [Ha! I've got all the friends I need.]\n{d87.1} - [Then you know that friendly people SOAR.]\n{d88.1} - [Uh. Right.]\n{d89.1} - [My mom taught me this: S– Smile. O– Offer your hand. A– Ask their name. R– Repeat their name and tell them yours. S-O-A-R. SOAR. It's how to be friendly! Want to practice?]\n{d90.1} - [Uh, nope.]\n{d91.1} - [I'll try.]\n{d92.1} - [Thank you.]\n{d93.1} - [Um-kay.]\n{d94.1} - [Say, “you're welcome.”]\n{d95.1} - [Um, you're welcome?]\n{d96.1} - [Okay, then. SOAR. That's SOAR like—]\n{d97.1} - [Sore like I fell down and hurt my knee, boo-hoo!]\n{d98.1} - [That's SOAR, like flying high, like being really successful at being friendly!]\n{d99.1} - [Gross. And not as funny as mine.]\n{d100.1} - [Alright. My turn, then your turn.]\n{d100.2} - [S– Smile. O– Offer your hand.]\n{d100.3} - [A– Ask their name. What's your name?]\n{d101.1} - [Um, Ed.]\n{d102.1} - [R– Repeat their name and tell them yours. Hi Ed, I'm Tory. Yay! Now your turn, Ed.]\n{d103.1} - [S– Smile.

I am practicing hopscotch.]\n{d132.1} - [Nope, you're not.]\n{d133.1} - [I am.]\n{d134.1} - [You're just jumping on the squares without using a marker.]\n{d135.1} - [That's true. But I don't know how to play with a marker.]\n{d136.1} - [You don't know how to play with a marker?]\n{d137.1} - [Wanna teach me?]\n{d138.1} - [Not really.]\n{d139.1} - [You're not really afraid of me, right? I don't bite. Show me? Please?]\n{d140.1} - [Well…]\n{d140.2} - [It's easy. I could show you in like, two seconds.]\n{d141.1} - [Well, there's lots of seconds before my mom gets here, so you can teach me thousands of times!]\n{d142.1} - [Whatever. But I'm serious. Two seconds! Then you have to leave me alone. Or else, I'll—]\n{d143.1} - [What?]\n{d144.1} - [Here, use this marker.]\n{d145.1} - [Hey, Ed!]\n{d146.1} - [Hey. What are you doing?]\n{d147.1} - [I don't want Ed to play. Okay, scoot back. Toss the marker down, then watch how I jump.]\n{d148.1} - [Nope. I can't.]\n{d149.1} - [Sure, you can. Do it.]\n{d150.1} - [Only if we all three play.]\n{d151.1} - [Look. You're new here. Ed doesn't care. Ed is used to being alone.]\n{d152.1} - [Why? Why is that?]\n{d153.1} - [He obviously likes it that way.]\n{d154.1} - [I'll just ask.]\n{d155.1} - [Sorry to disturb you, Ed, but I was just wondering why you sit alone.]\n{d156.1} - [You can't just ask that!]\n{d157.1} - [I just did.]\n{d158.1} - [I don't want to talk about it.]\n{d159.1} - [See? Just leave him.]\n{d160.1} - [You don't have to tell me right now, but I'll be hanging out right here if you want to talk.]\n{d161.1} - [Whatever.]\n{d162.1} - [Everybody hates me.]\n{d163.1} - [I'm sorry, I didn't hear that, I was singing.]\n{d164.1} - [Are you watching me?]\n{d165.1} - [I said, everyone hates me.]\n{d166.1} - [That's silly.]\n{d167.1} - [No, it isn't. It's true.]\n{d168.1} - [Well, I'm somebody, and I don't hate you. I barely even know you.]\n{d169.1} - [Nobody knows me.]\n{d170.1} - [Wait a minute. You said everyone hates you. Then you said that nobody knows you.]\n{d171.1} - [So?]\n{d172.1} - [If nobody knows you, then nobody hates you.]\n{d173.1} - [Huh?]\n{d174.1} - [I don't think you can hate what you don't know!]\n{d175.1} - [After I toss the marker on a square, I jump over it.]\n{d176.1} - [C'mon Ed. It's time for JOY! J– Just jump in. O– Own your place. Y– Yes, I can.]\n{d177.1} - [Do you know a lot of these things? Like SOAR, like JOY?]\n{d178.1} - [Oh, the letter games? They're kind of a code. My mom teaches me. She's an animal whisperer. She uses them to help young animals with friendships. So, it's time to SOAR with JOY.]\n{d179.1} - [I jump over it. I never touch that square again. See?]\n{d180.1} - [Ed is playing too.]\n{d181.1} - [Why?]\n{d182.1} - [I think you know. It's rude, it's bad manners, to leave someone out. And, I'm trying to use empathy.]\n{d183.1} - [Empathy?]\n{d184.1} - [It's putting yourself in someone else's shoes. Imagining what they must be feeling. Feeling how that feels.]\n{d185.1} - [So… You're feeling Ed's feelings?]\n{d186.1} - [Kinda. And being alone doesn't make Ed happy. So, Ed is gonna have to J-O-Y. JOY. J– Just jump in. O– Own my place. Y– Yes, I can.]\n{d187.1} - [Fine, but you know tortoises can't jump.]\n{d188.1} - [What?]\n{d189.1} - [That big old shell can't get off the ground.]\n{d190.1} - [Ed! Come on over. Let's learn hopscotch.]\n{d191.1} - [Okay then. Time for JOY.]\n{d192.1} - [Well, anyways. I toss the marker on a square, and I jump over it. I never touch the square again. See?]\n{d193.1} - [We clapped. What comes next?]\n{d194.1} - [Somebody takes a turn.]\n{d195.1} - [Before that. Manners?]\n{d196.1} - [Uh… Thank you? TORY: You're welcome. Way to go!]\n{d197.1} - [Okay. Ok ok. I'll try.]\n{d198.1} - [Sure? Cause I'm not helping you if you fall. You're on your own.]\n{d199.1} - [Time for JOY.]\n{d200.1} - [What. Is. That??]\n{d201.1} - [My ninja turtle head gear. Got it at the Shellebration last year.]\n{d202.1} - [Just toss the marker and hop!]\n{d203.1} - [Hey, didja know that the original hopscotch courts were over 100 feet long? Good thing they're shorter now. And the record hopscotch jumper finished the game in one minute and two seconds. And the rules change a lot, so—]\n{d204.1} - [Go already!]\n{d205.1} - [Hey! Not fair. No shoving.]\n{d206.1} - [Hey. Keeping our hands to ourselves is friendly. That was not.]\n{d207.1} - [This is dumb.]\n{d208.1} - [Then make it smart. Apologize.]\n{d209.1} - [JOY!]\n{d210.1} - [That. Was. Kinda. Fun!]\n{d211.1} - [Do you ever wonder about the hop on one foot rule?]\n{d212.1} - [I thought you didn't know how to play.]\n{d213.1} - [I don't. I just know how to hop.]\n{d213.2} - [And, I know how to apologize.]\n{d214.1} - [Show us.]\n{d215.1} - [You first.]\n{d216.1} - [Okay, okay. Ed, I'm sorry I shoved you.]\n{d217.1} - [Thanks.]\n{d218.1} - [Okay, now go?]\n{d219.1} - [‘Kay. No shoving. Here goes JOY!]\n{d220.1} - [Okay, that's over.]\n{d221.1} - [Hey. Wait up, guys.]\n{d222.1} - [I think somebody needs to practice being friendly. So, let's SOAR.]\n{d223.1} - [See this? I told you. This is hedgehog for lea'me alone. So, lea'me alone. I don't need friendly practice. I got friends.]\n{d224.1} - [Yep. They are super popular.]\n{d225.1} - [I am not.]\n{d226.1} - [Yeah, you are.]\n{d227.1} - [I'm not popular.]\n{d228.1} - [Yes, you are!]\n{d229.1} - [No, I'm not.]\n{d230.1} - [You got, like, a million Friendship Day treats.]\n{d231.1} - [Everyone did.]\n{d232.1} - [And if you tell people to do something, they do it.]\n{d233.1} - [I don't tell people what to do!]\n{d234.1} - [You always tell people not to let me play.]\n{d235.1} - [No, I—]\n{d236.1} - [And they do it. That's popular.]\n{d237.1} - [Whatever.]\n{d238.1} - [And they always laugh at your jokes. That's popular.]\n{d240.1} - [Why are you so mad? I would love it if everyone liked me.]\n{d241.1} - [Stop saying that!]\n{d242.1} - [Saying what?]\n{d243.1} - [That everyone likes me!]\n{d244.1} - [Everyone does!]\n{d245.1} - [No, they don't!]\n{d246.1} - [Who doesn't like you?]\n{d247.1} - [Okay. I'll prove it. Remember when I shared in morning circle today?]\n{d248.1} - [Yeah.]\n{d249.1} - [I told about my dog having puppies? Do you remember what kind of dog I have?]\n{d250.1} - [Um. No.]\n{d251.1} - [That's because I never said.]\n{d252.1} - [Well, knowing the kind of dog does kinda help us imagine better.]\n{d253.1} - [I know that. I forgot it.]\n{d254.1} - [You forgot what kind of dog you have?]\n{d255.1} - [I was standing in front of the class and I totally forgot it.]\n{d256.1} - [Ah. Nerves made your memory stop for a second. My mom says that can—]\n{d257.1} - [Anyway, I couldn't remember it. I said, “My dog is a–” and then I started stuttering. And these two girls in the back of the class kept laughing at me.]\n{d258.1} - [Yeah, I saw that.]\n{d259.1} - [And I got really hot. I could feel my face going red. I really wanted to curl right up. I sat back down and I felt… I don't know.]\n{d260.1} - [Embarrassed?]\n{d261.1} - [Right. And nobody said anything to me. We went out to recess, and all my friends stayed away from me. They knew I was upset and they just ignored me.]\n{d262.1} - [That's terrible.]\n{d263.1} - [It was terrible. They're supposed to be my friends. If I'm so popular, how come nobody would talk to me?]\n{d264.1} - [What would you want them to say?]\n{d265.1} - [I don't know. Like, “Are you okay?” or something.]\n{d266.1} - [A little empathy for you would have been good.]\n{d267.1} - [And, I think it's poor manners to laugh at somebody who is having a hard time.]\n{d268.1} - [Yeah. Empathy. Manners. Right.]\n{d269.1} - [Well, are you okay?]\n{d270.1} - [Yeah. I guess. I feel better now.]\n{d271.1} - [You just wanted someone to ask.]\n{d272.1} - [Yeah.]\n{d273.1} - [Okay, now you gotta SOAR with me.]\n{d274.1} - [It doesn't hurt. If I can do it, you can do it.]\n{d275.1} - [Okay…]\n{d276.1} - [I think you should do JOY first.]\n{d277.1} - [Good idea, Ed.]\n{d278.1} - [J– Just jump in. O– Own your space. Y– Yes, I can.]\n{d279.1} - [J– Just jump in. O– Own your space. Y– Yes, I can.]\n{d280.1} - [Okay, all together! J– Just jump in. O– Own your space. Y– Yes, I can. One more time! All together now! J– Just jump in. O– Own your space. Y– Yes, I can.]\n{d281.1} - [Wait, your mom taught you that?]\n{d282.1} - [Yeah. She helps kids be friendly and get better at making friends. Like us.]\n{d283.1} - [Well, I did tell you that I don't have any trouble making friends.]\n{d284.1} - [It can never hurt to be friendlier.]\n{d285.1} - [Okay. I have another game. Are you ready?]\n{d286.1} - [Sure.]\n{d287.1} - [Yes.]\n{d288.1} - [Questions. People who are good at making friends are good at asking questions. So, here's a beanbag from that game. We hold the beanbag, we ask a question, then we quickly toss the bag to someone else. And they ask a question and toss quickly to someone else. The game is called Speedy Q.]\n{d289.1} - [Wait, no answers? Just questions?]\n{d290.1} - [It's question practice. Not answer practice.]\n{d291.1} - [And also thinking fast?]\n{d292.1} - [Truth!]\n{d293.1} - [What kinds of questions?]\n{d294.1} - [Just a question. After you ask it, you toss the bag to the person who must ask the next question.]\n{d295.1} - [Got that.]\n{d296.1} - [Ed starts.]\n{d297.1} - [I can't think of anything.]\n{d298.1} - [Come on!]\n{d299.1} - [Um. Why is the sky blue?]\n{d300.1} - [Why did the chicken cross the road?]\n{d301.1} - [What kind of dog is Clifford the Big Red Dog?]\n{d302.1} - [Dogs or cats?]\n{d303.1} - [Um– Um—]\n{d304.1} - [Faster.]\n{d305.1} - [Cheese or meat?]\n{d306.1} - [Tater tots or french fries?]\n{d307.1} - [How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Pop?]\n{d308.1} - [Favorite movie?]\n{d309.1} - [Favorite song?]\n{d310.1} - [Where were you born?]\n{d311.1} - [Got any siblings?]\n{d312.1} - [What do you like to do with your family?]\n{d313.1} - [Can we answer?]\n{d314.1} - [Name of your dog?]\n{d315.1} - [Can we answer?]\n{d316.1} - [CAN WE ANSWER?]\n{d317.1} - [I wanna answer.]\n{d318.1} - [Can you ask a question?!]\n{d319.1} - [Why do you like the Mutant Ninja Turtles so much?]\n{d320.1} - [Why me?]\n{d321.1} - [And… stop.]\n{d322.1} - [Whoa. That was hard. Taking turns, thinking fast–]\n{d323.1} - [NOT ANSWERING the questions.]\n{d324.1} - [Okay, if you can remember a question you really wanted to answer, go.]\n{d325.1} - [I do like dogs. I have a big one. Her name is Gina. And, I do have siblings, a sister and a baby brother, and my family likes to go fishing together and sometimes we play games and–]\n{d326.1} - [I like cats, we have two of them. They are both orange. Tater tots are better because they hold more ketchup, and I like Mikey because they are the youngest and the Ninja Turtles make me proud to be a tortoise.]\n{d327.1} - [So, you didn't answer yet. Why Friendship Day?]\n{d328.1} - [Well, I'm a red fox, and I like all the red stuff, and the hearts, and—uh—it's my birthday.]\n{d329.1} - [What?]\n{d330.1} - [What?]\n{d331.1} - [See, we do learn about each other by asking questions.]\n{d332.1} - [Are you having a party? Are you having cake?]\n{d333.1} - [Oh, you should have a party!]\n{d334.1} - [Sure. I'll invite all my friends. See?]\n{d335.1} - [You got more than me.]\n{d336.1} - [And, you're new. They weren't ready for you.]\n{d337.1} - [Way to practice empathy. Happy birthday, anyway.]\n{d338.1} - [Well, thanks. So there's a treat from the teacher. And—]\n{d339.1} - [And one from me.]\n{d340.1} - [And one from me.]\n{d341.1} - [My mom—]\n{d342.1} - [And my dad.]\n{d343.1} - [—asked me to give one to everyone.]\n{d344.1} - [Be sure to thank your parents.]\n{d345.1} - [So, you're having a birthday party?

I know my mom will bring me.]\n{d349.1} - [But–]\n{d350.1} - [Nope. No buts. We're your friends now, right?]\n{d351.1} - [Yes, but, we didn't do the friendly meeting thing. I don't actually remember your name.]\n{d352.1} - [Oh! Almost forgot.]\n{d353.1} - [I'll start. SOAR. S– Smile. O– Offer your hand. A– Ask their name. R– Repeat their name and tell them yours.
