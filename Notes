Things that need to be included in order to fully utilize this program:
- A way to merge characters (for duplicate like names)
- A way to connect characters (for ones that have multiple people talking at once)

Fixes Needed:
    - Carly Reynolds:

        {stgd174} - [( <i> MR. PAXTON shows that he had his briefcase on him the entire time.)]
