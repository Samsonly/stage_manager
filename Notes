Things that need to be included in order to fully utilize this program:
- A way to merge characters (for duplicate like names)
- A way to connect characters (for ones that have multiple people talking at once)
- There should be a check for dialogue that is split, and if so, they should get different dialogue numbers, that way they can be spaced out
- refine scenic descriptions so the count is decimal based
- create logic for making sure parenthesis or quotaations are not being cut off with italic tags
% - logic for checking modified content for nontags
- make space deletion in modified content only for curly braces
% - logic for ensuring italic array is empty
- fix side bars swapping in interface
- fix the bottom staying up when minimized in interface
- add logic for full plays with only 1 act
- add logic for full plays with multiple acts
- add logic for plays/acts with only 1 scene

-title
  -play description
    -act
      -act description
        -scene
          -scene location
          -scene description
            -character
              -character direction
              -dialogue
            -stage direction
        -scene ending tag
    -act ending tag
-play ending tag

if (!act){ 
    create and make it outer structure
} else {
    if (prologue){
        check which comes first
        if (prologue comes first){
            make it before Act
        } else {
            make it a scene inside appropriate Act
        }
    }
    if (epilogue){
        check which is last
        if (epilogue is last){
            make it after Act
        } else {
            make it a scene inside appropriate Act
        }
    }
    
}

if there IS an Act, check to see if there is a prologue, if so which comes first

If (prologue){



}
