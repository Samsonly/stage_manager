{i11} - [(ROSE comes back out.)]
{i12} - [(Deflated)]
{i13} - [(GRANDMOTHER considers this for a moment, and then stands up and places the book on the nightstand.)]
{i14} - [(GRANDMOTHER leans over and kisses ROSE on the forehead, and tucks her in tightly. GRANDMOTHER exits.)]
{i15} - [(To herself)]
{i16} - [(ROSE rolls over and makes to go to sleep. After a moment of stillness, she quickly turns back and grabs the book GRANDMOTHER left behind and starts skimming through it.)]
{i17} - [(ROSE yawns)]
{i18} - [(ROSE continues to scan through the book to no avail. After another big yawn, ROSE slowly closes the book and holds it tightly, closes her eyes, and speaks outloud.)]
{i19} - [(ROSE opens one eye and peeks around the room. After seeing no change, she sighs, tosses the book on the chair, and turns over and falls asleep. After a few moments, a wind picks up, and the lights flicker. It builds up and grows a bit more intense, until just at the final moment: The wind goes silent with LIGHTS OUT.)]
{i20} - [LIGHTS UP on a WITCH in her house. Against one wall is an odd shape underneath a sheet. Next to the sheet a WOLF sleeps on the floor. WITCH is circling around a cauldron tossing in sprigs and seasoning. She keeps referencing a book as she does so.]
{i21-23} - [(WITCH throws in some thyme. She still has some herbs in her hand. She looks back at her book, then back at her herbs quizzically. She scratches her head.)]
{i24-30} - [(WITCH pauses a moment, shrugs, and tosses everything left in her hand into her cauldron and stirs it all together. She lifts the spoon to her mouth and considers it. After a moment, WITCH picks up a bell and rings it. Nothing. She rings it again. WOLF wakes and looks around. WITCH rings it again and doesn't stop. SPY runs in. WOLF settles back down.)]
{i31} - [(Silence.)]
{i32-34} - [(WITCH reaches inside of a pouch on her belt, takes a pinch out of it, and throws it in SPY's face. SPY sneezes and turns into SPY SHEEP. WOLF notices instantly and stands up.)]

{i42-43} - [(WOLF exits. WITCH returns to stirring her cauldron. LIGHTS OUT.)]
{i44} - [LIGHTS UP on ROSE laying on the ground in the middle of a field, in the same position that she had been in bed. The sun is shining brightly as she slowly wakes up. ROSE looks around in a daze, and after a foggy moment, frantically realizes she is not in her cozy bed anymore. After realizing that she is, in fact, in the middle of a field, and not in her bed, she stands up and takes in her surroundings.]
{i45-52} - [(ROSE takes a few steps to feel the ground. She stands still for a moment, and then closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. SPY enters silently, putting some herbs in a bag. He looks up and notices ROSE. He walks up to her. ROSE takes another couple of breaths, and then gives herself a small pinch on the arm. ROSE peeks and notices she is still in a field. She closes her eye again, and gives herself a big pinch.)]
{i53-55} - [(SPY circles around in front of her as ROSE peeks again, while rubbing her arm. This time she sees SPY and jumps back in surprise. SPY jumps back too.)]
{i56} - [you]

{i59-60} - [(ROSE turns and starts to walk away, but realizes she has no idea where she is going.)]
{i61} - [why]
{i62} - [(ROSE turns to face SPY.)]
{i63} - [(SPY takes this in for a moment.)]
{i64} - [I]
{i65} - [you]
{i66} - [(ROSE takes a deep breath.)]
{i67} - [(ROSE waits for SPY to fill in his name. He doesn't.)]
{i68-69} - [(ROSE walks past SPY, heading in the direction that SPY was heading to. SPY notices this and rushes to cut her off.)]
{i70} - [(ROSE stops and stares at SPY.)]
{i71} - [(Clearly uncomfortable)]
{i72} - [(Sarcastically)]
{i73} - [(SPY stops moving.)]
{i74-75} - [(ROSE moves out of SPY's grasp and walks back in the direction that she started. SPY is slightly taken aback.)]

{i82} - [(Exiting)]
{i83} - [(SPY is alone on stage. He heads off in the direction of the WITCH. LIGHTS OUT.)]
{i84} - [LIGHTS UP as ROSE walks throw a meadow. As she walks, a few HELPING BIRDS begin flying around her head. She waves them away, but even more join. She starts moving quickly to try and get past them, and as she does, she stumbles over SNOW. In doing so, a piece of apple stumbles from SNOW's mouth. ROSE falls to the ground. SNOW coughs and sits up. ROSE turns and notices SNOW and the piece of apple and groans.]

{i96} - [(To herself)]
{i97-98} - [(SNOW notices a half eaten apple on the ground and picks it up.)]
{i99} - [long]
{i100-101} - [(SNOW wipes off the apple and moves to take a bite from it. ROSE, seeing what she is about to do, swats it from her hand.)]

{i115} - [(ROSE doesn't stop.)]
{i116-119} - [(ROSE and SNOW approach the entrance to the woods. Sitting up on a rock is RED, part of her face cloaked in shadow. Neither notices her, but she is keenly watching both of them. Just before they enter, RED speaks up.)]
{i120} - [(SNOW jumps. ROSE is annoyed at yet another obstacle.)]
{i121-122} - [(ROSE starts to move into the woods. SNOW stands back, she does not want to go after a wolf.)]
{i123} - [(RED hops down from her perch.)]
{i124-125} - [(LIGHTS DIM. WOLF enters, and the scene from the woods is replayed on stage as RED tells the rest of the story.)]
{i126} - [(RED pulls out an old axe from a sheath on her back.)]
{i127-128} - [(RED pulls back her hood and points to a large scar along the side of her face. ROSE and SNOW lean in to investigate.)]
{i129} - [(RED nods as she re-sheaths her axe.)]
{i130-131} - [(There is a loud and distant scream that comes from the woods. Everyone looks in that direction.)]
{i132} - [(ROSE hesitates for a moment, surprised she is about to say this.)]
{i133-134} - [(SNOW looks from ROSE to RED. She takes a slight apologetic step back.)]

{i137} - [(RED looks away.)]
{i138} - [(To SNOW)]

{i140} - [(RED dismisses ROSE. SNOW is conflicted, but doesn't move.)]
{i141-143} - [(ROSE turns and runs into the woods. SNOW half moves to stop her but doesn't. She hesitates, and then finally runs in. RED sits there for a moment, then sighs and joins them.)]
{i144} - [A young MAIDEN is chained to a wall. Next to her, WITCH is standing holding a small bowl and a wooden spoon. She is feeding the MAIDEN, who does not seem to enjoy whatever is in the pot.]

{i147-148} - [(WITCH considers this for a moment, and then instantly mockingly, yet convincingly, defeated.)]
{i149-150} - [(PRINCE CHARMING hesitates. This is not how he expected things to go. He relaxes a little bit. Still very confused.)]
{i151} - [(WITCH bows to him, but does so very feebly. She grabs her back in pain.)]
{i152-153} - [(WITCH pretends to throw out her back. PRINCE CHARMING rushes to her side to help.)]
